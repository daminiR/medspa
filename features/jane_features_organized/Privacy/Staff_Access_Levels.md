Do you need different privacy settings for your staff members? Or are you wondering which permissions or access level to give them?
Jane’s Staff Access Levels allow you to grant, remove, change, and limit staff member access to private or confidential information, client files, billings, and major settings in your Jane account so staff members only see what they need to see.
Note📝
:
Only a
Full Access
user or
Account Owner
can view and update the Staff Access Level and privacy settings of another staff member.
So what access levels exist and what can they do? Let’s take a look at the different permission levels:
No Access
Practitioner (Limited)
Practitioner Front Desk
Practitioner Front Desk (All Locations)
Front Desk
Administrative/All Billing
Full Access
Account Owner
And we’ll look at Jane’s more granular permissions and restrictions:
Active
Access Billing
Access Charts
Manage Shifts
Are you a visual person? We totally get it—so are we! Click below to see a visual of staff permission levels:
A Visual Breakdown of Staff Permissions
Updating a Staff Member’s Access Level
To change the privacy level of a staff account, a
Full Access
user has two options:
Option One:
Head over to the
Settings
tab, then click on
Staff Permissions
in the left sidebar menu. This is a quick way to view and edit the
Role
or permission level of a staff member all in one place.
Option Two:
Another way to view and edit the permissions is to head over to the
Staff
tab and click on the staff member’s name to open up their profile. From there, you’ll want to click on the
Edit/Settings
tab and then on
Permissions & Commissions.
We know it can be tricky to remember what each access level grants, so we tucked in a short explanation of each role right for quick access.
In either place, you can update their
Role
and set additional permissions and restrictions, which affect their access level within the Jane account.
Note
📝:
Regardless of their access level, if a treatment is specifically assigned to a staff member under the
Settings
tab >
Treatments, Classes, Group Appointments
, they will be able to edit the settings of that treatment under their
Staff Profile
. For more information on this, check out our
Setting up Treatments
guide doc for more details.
Jane Staff Access Levels / Roles
Each
permission level
in Jane provides staff members with the ability to see and do different things within the Jane account. It’s important to be aware of your compliance obligations and ensure every staff member has the right level of access to what they need for their job.
Let’s take a look at the different permission levels from the least amount of access to the most.
No Access
This permission level removes someone’s access to the administrative or staff side of Jane. It’s most often used for staff members who have left your practice and should no longer have staff privileges within the clinic:
In terms of what a staff profile with no access can see, they’ll still be able to log in as a patient with the ability to view the online booking site and their
My Account Patient Portal
. They
will not
have access to the administrative side or have staff-level access to Jane, which includes patient or client data, the admin schedule and reports.
Practitioner (Limited)
This permission level grants the most basic level of access to a Jane account and is the most popular privacy level for strict confidentiality needs, such as with mental health clinicians and therapists.
Staff Profiles set to
Practitioner (Limited)
can view the following:
Their own schedule and appointments
The schedule and appointments of staff members they supervise
Their own staff profile
Their own billings, invoices, and metrics
Their own appointments, scheduling, and client retention reports
Their own patients — specifically, those who have past or future appointments with the staff member
Contacts who have
relationships
with their patients
Under the general
Settings
tab for the Jane account, a profile set to this access level can only see the following options:
Dashboard
with their own patient metrics
Emails
to preview how Jane’s emails and notifications appear to clients
Forms & Surveys
, but they can only see and create Clinical Surveys
Integrations
, but they can only see
Physitrack
and
Fullscript
since multiple integrations can be set up for each of these platforms.
Note:
📝 A
Practitioner (Limited)
staff profile may be able to see other staff members’ charts and client files if they have overlapping patients
and
if those charts are shared.
To prevent a staff member from accessing another staff member’s shared charts, you can remove their
Access to Shared Charts
permission
This access level also
does not
have access to the
Communications
tab with a patient’s profile. To confirm if a notification has been sent out, staff can head over to the Schedule tab, select the appointment and within the
Appointment Panel
scroll down to the
History & Status
section:
This access level is also not able to add or remove disciplines from their profile and they’ll see “you don’t have any disciplines created. They’ll need to reach out to a user with a higher access level if they need to opt-in/out of another discipline:
Staff members with this access level can cancel, delete and reschedule their own patient appointments and those of staff members they supervise.
Practitioner / Front Desk
This permission level provides more front desk capabilities but still limits a person’s access to billing, reports, and major settings in Jane.
A staff profile with the Practitioner/ Front Desk role can:
View and Edit all patient or client profiles, including appointment history
View other staff member profiles (with limited information)
View other practitioners’ schedules at their own location, but are unable to edit shifts for other staff members
Process payments for appointments completed by other practitioners at the same location
Only see their own invoices and billing reports
Under the general
Settings
tab for the Jane account, a profile set to this access level can only see the following options:
Dashboard
with their own patient metrics
Emails
to preview how Jane’s emails appear
Forms & Surveys
, but they can only see and create Clinical Surveys
Integrations
for Physitrack and Fullscript, but they can only see and integrate their own Physitrack and Fullscript accounts
Because this role includes front desk capabilities, a staff member with the Practitioner / Front Desk access level can help manage a patient’s current bookings at
any location
from within the patient’s profile, but they can’t see the Schedule of locations they’re not listed at.
Practitioner / Front Desk (All Locations)
This permission level is essentially the same as
Practitioner / Front Desk
. It has no additional permissions other than:
Being able to see
all
staff member schedules and client appointments
Being able to book appointments at any location — not just the locations they’re opted-in to
A profile with the permission level of
Practitioner / Front Desk (All Locations)
can still only see their own invoices and billing reports and has the same access to clinic Settings as
Practitioner / Front Desk
.
Front Desk
This permission level is very similar to the
Practitioner / Front Desk
access levels but with a few more billing permissions so they can handle day-end procedures. They won’t be able to see any of the staff settings like the
Permissions & Commissions
tab within a staff member’s profile.
Someone who is set to
Front Desk
can:
View all staff members’ invoices, schedules, and patient profiles
Book and manage appointments for patients in any location
Access the same clinic Settings as the Practitioner access levels
When it comes to
Reports
, a Front Desk staff member will only see their own billing information, like the other Practitioner access levels. However, they can see clinic-wide information in the:
Transactions and Jane Payments Transactions Reports
Return Visit Reminders Report
Insurance Policies Report
Treatment Plans Report (if they have the
Access to Shared Charts
permission)
Under the
Settings
tab, they will have the same options as the
Practitioner
access levels.
Administrative / All Billing
This permission level has more access to billing and clinic-wide settings.
A staff profile set to the
Administrative / All Billing
permission level can:
View all staff members’ invoices, schedules, and patients
Unapply payments and delete external payments (but only if the payment was received that day)
Create and manage Tags, Treatments, Products, Packages, and Memberships settings
Create and manage Insurers, Billing Codes, Fillable Forms, the Reconciliation Date, and Teleplan Info settings
When it comes to
Reports
, an
Administrative / All Billing
staff member can see:
All Appointments Reports
All Billing Reports
Potential Duplicates Report
Referral Report
Treatment Plans Report
This access level does not have permission to view the following reports:
Jane Payments Payouts
Under the
Settings
tab, they’ll have access to the following clinic-wide settings:
Dashboard
: View for all staff
Treatments, Classes & Group Appointments
: They can create and edit the clinic appointment types
Products
: They can edit and create new products
Packages and Memberships
: They can create new packages and memberships
Reconciliation Date
: They can set this date and it’ll apply to clinic-wide billings
For those on the
Insurance Plan
, staff profiles with this access level can view the following:
Billing Codes
can be created and edited
Insurers
can be created and edited
Fillable Forms
can be created
Teleplan Info
for the integration can be updated for those located in BC
Full Access
This permission level has access to nearly everything in the Jane account. They can:
See all reports and clinic billings
Create new staff members and manage their access level, information, and preferences
Manage all clinic settings
Full Access is usually reserved for a trusted office manager or administrator. They have the highest level of access, aside from the Account Owner.
Account Owner
There is only one
Account Owner
per Jane account and they are considered the legal custodian of data. This permission level by default will have Full Access to the Jane account and is the only staff profile that can additionally:
Manage the Jane subscription
Update the credit card paying for the subscription
Authorize the bulk export or transfer of data
Authorize the Jane Team to make changes to the account
Remove access from another Full Access user
Transfer ownership of the Jane account
Update the privacy level of another staff members’ charts
Delete intake forms and the charts of another staff member
It’s very important that Account Ownership is assigned to the
right person
at the clinic, as they are responsible for the subscription.
For more information on what Account Ownership means, see our guide doc on
Who Should Be the Account Owner?
for more details.
Additional Permissions and Restrictions
In addition to the Staff Access Roles, there are more granular permissions to further grant or restrict a staff member’s access to information.
Active
If a staff profile is set to
Active
:
Their profile will be visible in your
Staff
list and on
Reports
They can access the administrative side of Jane,
as long as they’re not set to
No Access
, of course
😉
To remove a staff profile’s access to the administrative side of Jane, you can uncheck the
Active
box in the Staff Permissions area:
No Access vs Inactive — what’s the difference?
Setting a profile to have
No Access
means they won’t be able to log into the administrative side of Jane (although they can still log in as a patient).
On the other hand, making a profile
Inactive
means they won’t be able to log in as a staff member
and
they’ll be hidden from your schedule, staff list, and all reporting.
If a profile is
Active
but is set to
No Access
, it means this person can’t access your Jane account as a staff member, but you’ll be able to see them on reports and in your staff list if you need to retrieve historical information — handy come tax time.
To learn more about marking a staff profile as inactive, you can check out our guide doc on
Deactivating a Staff Member
for more detailed information.
Access Billing
This permission enables or disables all billing features for a staff member.
If
Access Billing
is
enabled
, the staff member will be able to take payments, sell products, manage insurance, and access billing data according to their Role / Staff Access Level.
If Access Billing is
disabled
, they will lose all access to billing features in Jane. A staff member without Access Billing is unable to:
See the Pay button and accept payment for appointments
See or add insurance policies for appointments
Sell or use products, packages, and memberships
Access the Billing tab at the top of Jane or within a patient’s profile
Access any invoices or billing reports
Access any of their own financial data
View Treatment prices on the administrative side of the Jane account. They will be able to see prices on the online booking site, including with gift card sales, if they’re set to be displayed online.
Here’s what they’ll be able to see in the
Appointment Panel
once they click on an appointment on the schedule:
Access Charts
This permission (also known as the “View Charts Shared by Other Staff” permission) is the ability for a staff member to see chart notes and files created by other staff members:
If Access Charts is
enabled
, they’ll be able to see charts authored by other practitioners, as long as those charts have been shared by the author:
If Access Charts is
disabled
, the staff member can still see and create their own charts. But they won’t be able to see anyone else’s charts:
You might consider removing
Chart Access
for an admin, bookkeeper, accountant, or other non-clinical staff who have no reason to view patient charts.
💡 If staff members are allowed to see some charts but not all, there are additional
Chart Privacy Settings
every staff member can use instead to make their own charts more or less private.
Manage Shifts
This permission allows or prevents staff members from working with Shifts in the Schedule:
If Manage Shifts is
enabled
, a staff member will be able to create, edit, and delete their own Shifts and the Shifts of any other practitioner whose Schedule they have permission to view:
If Manage Shifts is
disabled
, the
Shifts
button will disappear from the Schedule and the staff member will not be able to add, delete, or modify any Shifts on the schedule, including their own:

Do you need different privacy settings for your staff members? Or are you wondering which permissions or access level to give them?
Jane’s Staff Access Levels allow you to grant, remove, change, and limit staff member access to private or confidential information, client files, billings, and major settings in your Jane account so staff members only see what they need to see.
Note📝
:
Only a
Full Access
user or
Account Owner
can view and update the Staff Access Level and privacy settings of another staff member.
So what access levels exist and what can they do? Let’s take a look at the different permission levels:
No Access
Practitioner (Limited)
Practitioner Front Desk
Practitioner Front Desk (All Locations)
Front Desk
Administrative/All Billing
Full Access
Account Owner
And we’ll look at Jane’s more granular permissions and restrictions:
Active
Access Billing
Access Charts
Manage Shifts
Are you a visual person? We totally get it—so are we! Click below to see a visual of staff permission levels:
A Visual Breakdown of Staff Permissions
Updating a Staff Member’s Access Level
To change the privacy level of a staff account, a
Full Access
user has two options:
Option One:
Head over to the
Settings
tab, then click on
Staff Permissions
in the left sidebar menu. This is a quick way to view and edit the
Role
or permission level of a staff member all in one place.
Option Two:
Another way to view and edit the permissions is to head over to the
Staff
tab and click on the staff member’s name to open up their profile. From there, you’ll want to click on the
Edit/Settings
tab and then on
Permissions & Commissions.
We know it can be tricky to remember what each access level grants, so we tucked in a short explanation of each role right for quick access.
In either place, you can update their
Role
and set additional permissions and restrictions, which affect their access level within the Jane account.
Note
📝:
Regardless of their access level, if a treatment is specifically assigned to a staff member under the
Settings
tab >
Treatments, Classes, Group Appointments
, they will be able to edit the settings of that treatment under their
Staff Profile
. For more information on this, check out our
Setting up Treatments
guide doc for more details.
Jane Staff Access Levels / Roles
Each
permission level
in Jane provides staff members with the ability to see and do different things within the Jane account. It’s important to be aware of your compliance obligations and ensure every staff member has the right level of access to what they need for their job.
Let’s take a look at the different permission levels from the least amount of access to the most.
No Access
This permission level removes someone’s access to the administrative or staff side of Jane. It’s most often used for staff members who have left your practice and should no longer have staff privileges within the clinic:
In terms of what a staff profile with no access can see, they’ll still be able to log in as a patient with the ability to view the online booking site and their
My Account Patient Portal
. They
will not
have access to the administrative side or have staff-level access to Jane, which includes patient or client data, the admin schedule and reports.
Practitioner (Limited)
This permission level grants the most basic level of access to a Jane account and is the most popular privacy level for strict confidentiality needs, such as with mental health clinicians and therapists.
Staff Profiles set to
Practitioner (Limited)
can view the following:
Their own schedule and appointments
The schedule and appointments of staff members they supervise
Their own staff profile
Their own billings, invoices, and metrics
Their own appointments, scheduling, and client retention reports
Their own patients — specifically, those who have past or future appointments with the staff member
Contacts who have
relationships
with their patients
Under the general
Settings
tab for the Jane account, a profile set to this access level can only see the following options:
Dashboard
with their own patient metrics
Emails
to preview how Jane’s emails and notifications appear to clients
Forms & Surveys
, but they can only see and create Clinical Surveys
Integrations
, but they can only see
Physitrack
and
Fullscript
since multiple integrations can be set up for each of these platforms.
Note:
📝 A
Practitioner (Limited)
staff profile may be able to see other staff members’ charts and client files if they have overlapping patients
and
if those charts are shared.
To prevent a staff member from accessing another staff member’s shared charts, you can remove their
Access to Shared Charts
permission
This access level also
does not
have access to the
Communications
tab with a patient’s profile. To confirm if a notification has been sent out, staff can head over to the Schedule tab, select the appointment and within the
Appointment Panel
scroll down to the
History & Status
section:
This access level is also not able to add or remove disciplines from their profile and they’ll see “you don’t have any disciplines created. They’ll need to reach out to a user with a higher access level if they need to opt-in/out of another discipline:
Staff members with this access level can cancel, delete and reschedule their own patient appointments and those of staff members they supervise.
Practitioner / Front Desk
This permission level provides more front desk capabilities but still limits a person’s access to billing, reports, and major settings in Jane.
A staff profile with the Practitioner/ Front Desk role can:
View and Edit all patient or client profiles, including appointment history
View other staff member profiles (with limited information)
View other practitioners’ schedules at their own location, but are unable to edit shifts for other staff members
Process payments for appointments completed by other practitioners at the same location
Only see their own invoices and billing reports
Under the general
Settings
tab for the Jane account, a profile set to this access level can only see the following options:
Dashboard
with their own patient metrics
Emails
to preview how Jane’s emails appear
Forms & Surveys
, but they can only see and create Clinical Surveys
Integrations
for Physitrack and Fullscript, but they can only see and integrate their own Physitrack and Fullscript accounts
Because this role includes front desk capabilities, a staff member with the Practitioner / Front Desk access level can help manage a patient’s current bookings at
any location
from within the patient’s profile, but they can’t see the Schedule of locations they’re not listed at.
Practitioner / Front Desk (All Locations)
This permission level is essentially the same as
Practitioner / Front Desk
. It has no additional permissions other than:
Being able to see
all
staff member schedules and client appointments
Being able to book appointments at any location — not just the locations they’re opted-in to
A profile with the permission level of
Practitioner / Front Desk (All Locations)
can still only see their own invoices and billing reports and has the same access to clinic Settings as
Practitioner / Front Desk
.
Front Desk
This permission level is very similar to the
Practitioner / Front Desk
access levels but with a few more billing permissions so they can handle day-end procedures. They won’t be able to see any of the staff settings like the
Permissions & Commissions
tab within a staff member’s profile.
Someone who is set to
Front Desk
can:
View all staff members’ invoices, schedules, and patient profiles
Book and manage appointments for patients in any location
Access the same clinic Settings as the Practitioner access levels
When it comes to
Reports
, a Front Desk staff member will only see their own billing information, like the other Practitioner access levels. However, they can see clinic-wide information in the:
Transactions and Jane Payments Transactions Reports
Return Visit Reminders Report
Insurance Policies Report
Treatment Plans Report (if they have the
Access to Shared Charts
permission)
Under the
Settings
tab, they will have the same options as the
Practitioner
access levels.
Administrative / All Billing
This permission level has more access to billing and clinic-wide settings.
A staff profile set to the
Administrative / All Billing
permission level can:
View all staff members’ invoices, schedules, and patients
Unapply payments and delete external payments (but only if the payment was received that day)
Create and manage Tags, Treatments, Products, Packages, and Memberships settings
Create and manage Insurers, Billing Codes, Fillable Forms, the Reconciliation Date, and Teleplan Info settings
When it comes to
Reports
, an
Administrative / All Billing
staff member can see:
All Appointments Reports
All Billing Reports
Potential Duplicates Report
Referral Report
Treatment Plans Report
This access level does not have permission to view the following reports:
Jane Payments Payouts
Under the
Settings
tab, they’ll have access to the following clinic-wide settings:
Dashboard
: View for all staff
Treatments, Classes & Group Appointments
: They can create and edit the clinic appointment types
Products
: They can edit and create new products
Packages and Memberships
: They can create new packages and memberships
Reconciliation Date
: They can set this date and it’ll apply to clinic-wide billings
For those on the
Insurance Plan
, staff profiles with this access level can view the following:
Billing Codes
can be created and edited
Insurers
can be created and edited
Fillable Forms
can be created
Teleplan Info
for the integration can be updated for those located in BC
Full Access
This permission level has access to nearly everything in the Jane account. They can:
See all reports and clinic billings
Create new staff members and manage their access level, information, and preferences
Manage all clinic settings
Full Access is usually reserved for a trusted office manager or administrator. They have the highest level of access, aside from the Account Owner.
Account Owner
There is only one
Account Owner
per Jane account and they are considered the legal custodian of data. This permission level by default will have Full Access to the Jane account and is the only staff profile that can additionally:
Manage the Jane subscription
Update the credit card paying for the subscription
Authorize the bulk export or transfer of data
Authorize the Jane Team to make changes to the account
Remove access from another Full Access user
Transfer ownership of the Jane account
Update the privacy level of another staff members’ charts
Delete intake forms and the charts of another staff member
It’s very important that Account Ownership is assigned to the
right person
at the clinic, as they are responsible for the subscription.
For more information on what Account Ownership means, see our guide doc on
Who Should Be the Account Owner?
for more details.
Additional Permissions and Restrictions
In addition to the Staff Access Roles, there are more granular permissions to further grant or restrict a staff member’s access to information.
Active
If a staff profile is set to
Active
:
Their profile will be visible in your
Staff
list and on
Reports
They can access the administrative side of Jane,
as long as they’re not set to
No Access
, of course
😉
To remove a staff profile’s access to the administrative side of Jane, you can uncheck the
Active
box in the Staff Permissions area:
No Access vs Inactive — what’s the difference?
Setting a profile to have
No Access
means they won’t be able to log into the administrative side of Jane (although they can still log in as a patient).
On the other hand, making a profile
Inactive
means they won’t be able to log in as a staff member
and
they’ll be hidden from your schedule, staff list, and all reporting.
If a profile is
Active
but is set to
No Access
, it means this person can’t access your Jane account as a staff member, but you’ll be able to see them on reports and in your staff list if you need to retrieve historical information — handy come tax time.
To learn more about marking a staff profile as inactive, you can check out our guide doc on
Deactivating a Staff Member
for more detailed information.
Access Billing
This permission enables or disables all billing features for a staff member.

Access Billing
is
enabled
, the staff member will be able to take payments, sell products, manage insurance, and access billing data according to their Role / Staff Access Level.
If Access Billing is
disabled
, they will lose all access to billing features in Jane. A staff member without Access Billing is unable to:
See the Pay button and accept payment for appointments
See or add insurance policies for appointments
Sell or use products, packages, and memberships
Access the Billing tab at the top of Jane or within a patient’s profile
Access any invoices or billing reports
Access any of their own financial data
View Treatment prices on the administrative side of the Jane account. They will be able to see prices on the online booking site, including with gift card sales, if they’re set to be displayed online.
Here’s what they’ll be able to see in the
Appointment Panel
once they click on an appointment on the schedule:
Access Charts
This permission (also known as the “View Charts Shared by Other Staff” permission) is the ability for a staff member to see chart notes and files created by other staff members:
If Access Charts is
enabled
, they’ll be able to see charts authored by other practitioners, as long as those charts have been shared by the author:
If Access Charts is
disabled
, the staff member can still see and create their own charts. But they won’t be able to see anyone else’s charts:
You might consider removing
Chart Access
for an admin, bookkeeper, accountant, or other non-clinical staff who have no reason to view patient charts.
💡 If staff members are allowed to see some charts but not all, there are additional
Chart Privacy Settings
every staff member can use instead to make their own charts more or less private.
Manage Shifts
This permission allows or prevents staff members from working with Shifts in the Schedule:
If Manage Shifts is
enabled
, a staff member will be able to create, edit, and delete their own Shifts and the Shifts of any other practitioner whose Schedule they have permission to view:
If Manage Shifts is
disabled
, the
Shifts
button will disappear from the Schedule and the staff member will not be able to add, delete, or modify any Shifts on the schedule, including their own:
