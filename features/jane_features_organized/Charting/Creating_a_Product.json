You’re in the perfect place!\nCreating a Product\nViewing the Log of Changes for a Product\nAdditional Notes & FAQ\nNote\n📝:\nIf your clinic needs to charge taxes on product sales, check out our guide on\nSetting Up Sales Taxes in Jane\nthat has more details on that process before you jump into creating a new product.\nCreating a Product\nTo get started, a staff member with\nAdministrative / All Billing\naccess will want to head over to the\nSettings\ntab and then select\nProducts\nwithin the left sidebar menu:\nOn the Products screen, click\nNew Product\nin the top-right:\nNow you can fill in the information about your new product! Only the product’s\nName\n,\nPrice\n, and\nIncome Category\nare required:\nYou can assign a product to any income category that you have created in Jane.  This allows you to further differentiate your products to different reporting categories and also to compensate your staff differently for different product sales.\nIf it’s a physical product or inventory, you can also enter your\nQuantity\nor supplies on hand per location to keep track of how much you sell:\nWhen you’re ready, just hit\nCreate Product\nat the bottom to save your product.\nOther Product Fields\nWondering what those other fields are meant for? Let’s take a look:\nProduct Code\nWhile the\nProduct Code\nfield isn’t mandatory, you can use a barcode scanner to scan your product’s barcode into this field! Then, when you\nSell This Product\n, you can scan the barcode into Jane to quickly check out your customer:\nDescription\nThe Description Field also allows you to add extra detailed notes to show up on the receipt for that product:\nReorder Threshold\nThe reorder threshold will trigger the product to appear on your\nInventory Report\norder list when the stock is one less than the threshold. This allows you to list a product without a quantity for items that are a special order.\n💡\nJane Tip:\nThe Reorder Threshold applies to each location individually. For example, if your yoga mat Reorder Threshold is 5, and you have 35 yoga mats at the Village but only 4 at the District, your Inventory Report will show that you need to reorder yoga mats for the District only.\nViewing the Log of Changes for a Product\nNeed to keep tabs on your ever-changing inventory? Jane keeps track of everything - recording every last change\nNOTE\n📍:\nSince this is a clinic-wide setting, only users with\nFull Access\nto the account can view this area. Check out our guide on\nStaff Access Levels\nfor more details.\nTo start, you’ll want to head over to the\nSettings\ntab and select\nProducts\nfrom the left sidebar menu. You can browse the page for the desired product inventory you need to investigate. Alternatively, you can use the search bar to help narrow down the options.\nFrom here, you can click on the blue\nView Log\ntext under the\nInventory\ncolumn.\nThis log will show a list of when inventory increased or decreased. Additionally, you’ll be able to see the reason for the change, any notes from your lovely staff and the date those actions took place - all in one go.\nIf you’d like to see a bit more details for a purchase, click on the blue\nCreated Purchase\ntext. Jane will redirect you straight to the invoice for a little extra sleuthing 🔍\nHow to archive a Product:\nFrom time to time, you may need need to delete a Product from the Product List so it’s no longer part of your inventory. To do so, you can archive a Product.\nTo archive a Product, head to\nSettings\nin the blue banner at the top of your Jane page, click on\nProducts\nin the left sidebar menu, find the Product in the list, and click\nEdit\n.\nScroll to the bottom of the Product page and click the\nArchive\nbutton.\nYou can view archived Products, as well as unarchive them, by heading to\nSettings\n, then to\nProducts\n, and then clicking the\nShow Archived\nbutton at the top of the page.\nArchived products will be displayed with a grey\nArchived\nbadge. You can click\nEdit\nto view the Product details, and you can also click the blue\nSave & Unarchive\nbutton if needed.\n💡\nJane tip\n: the Products List can be accessed by staff members with billing access, including the Administrative / All Billing, Full Access, and Account Owner\nstaff access levels\n.\nAdditional Notes & FAQ\nHow can I view a list of products that have tax added to them?\nA staff member with\nFull Access\ncan head over to the\nSettings\ntab and click on\nProducts\nwithin the left sidebar menu. Jane will display a list of all the products, including a column with which tax has been added.\nIf you’d like to learn more about pulling a product list in Jane, check out our\nThe Inventory Report, Product Price Lists and Calculating Retail Value\nguide for more details.\nNext up, click here to learn how to\nSell a Product\n!\nIf you have questions, or if you want to chat through workflows in Jane, please don’t hesitate to\nget in touch\n, we’re always happy to hear from you. 💙\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter.\nWelcome\nWelcome to the Jane Guide\nCode of Conduct\nFeature Requests\nJane's Brand Assets\nAccount Setup Consultations\nWhat's new in Jane?\nWhat's new in Jane Webinar\nJane's Changelog\nJane's Monthly Newsletter\nUpdates to Interchange Fees for Visa & Mastercard in Canada 🇨🇦\nHoward Spector joins Jane!\nJane Appoints Dan Davidow as Chief Marketing Officer\nJane App's Support Team Wins a Bronze Stevie® Award\nDemo Videos\nPractitioner's Home Base: Day Sheets & Charts\nJane in Action\nPractitioner Training:  Initial Signing In and Overview\nInsurance: Billing a Visit to a 3rd Party\nScheduling: Managing the Schedule with Many Practitioners\nDisciplines, Treatments, & Billing Settings\nSetting up Staff & Scheduling Shifts\nCharting: Signing, Duplicating & Symbols\nScheduling: Complete Schedule Overview\nBilling: Accepting Payments\nLaunching an Insurer Portal\nQuick Start\nStep 1: Clinic Information\nStep 2: Disciplines\nStep 3: Treatments\nStep 4: Staff\nStep 5: Schedule or Diary\nAdditional Set Up Recommendations\nPractitioner Step 1: Practitioner Training\nPractitioner Step 2: Treatments\nPractitioner Step 3: Shifts\nPractitioner Step 4: Online Booking\nPractitioner Step 5: Charting\nAccount Setup Consultations\nSwitching to Jane\nSwitching is easy with Jane on your team\nJane vs. SimplePractice\nAccount Basics\nHow To Check Who's Listed As Account Owner\nChecklist for Starting with Jane\nBrowser Requirements\nDevice & Network Recommendations\nUsing Jane on a Tablet\nUsing Jane on a Smartphone\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nAuto-Logout Duration\nUpdating Your Clinic Email Address & Phone Number\nLog In Help: Username and Password\nEnabling Patient Self Check-in\nAdding a Location\nBooking  a Break on a Mobile Device (Phone or other Small Screen)\nMoving Your Practice to a New Location\nMultiple Locations or Multiple Accounts: How to Set Up Jane for Independent Locations or Practitioners\nAccessibility in Jane\nI Can't Access My Jane Account: A Troubleshooting Guide\nHow to Archive a Treatment, Class or Group Appointment\nBookmarking Your Jane Account for Easy Access\nViewing Protected Financial Documents (For Patients)\nSwitching to the Balance Plan\nAdding a Billing Address for Locations\nUnauthorized Access: What to Do if Your Laptop/Phone is Lost or Stolen\nHow to Archive/Unarchive a Discipline\nHow to Change the Name of Your Clinic\nImporting to Jane\nHow to Import Data to Jane (Overview)\nBasics of Importing to Jane\nDiving Deeper Into Importing to Jane\nWhere Can You Import From?

You’re in the perfect place!\nCreating a Product\nViewing the Log of Changes for a Product\nAdditional Notes & FAQ\nNote\n📝:\nIf your clinic needs to charge taxes on product sales, check out our guide on\nSetting Up Sales Taxes in Jane\nthat has more details on that process before you jump into creating a new product.\nCreating a Product\nTo get started, a staff member with\nAdministrative / All Billing\naccess will want to head over to the\nSettings\ntab and then select\nProducts\nwithin the left sidebar menu:\nOn the Products screen, click\nNew Product\nin the top-right:\nNow you can fill in the information about your new product! Only the product’s\nName\n,\nPrice\n, and\nIncome Category\nare required:\nYou can assign a product to any income category that you have created in Jane.  This allows you to further differentiate your products to different reporting categories and also to compensate your staff differently for different product sales.\nIf it’s a physical product or inventory, you can also enter your\nQuantity\nor supplies on hand per location to keep track of how much you sell:\nWhen you’re ready, just hit\nCreate Product\nat the bottom to save your product.\nOther Product Fields\nWondering what those other fields are meant for? Let’s take a look:\nProduct Code\nWhile the\nProduct Code\nfield isn’t mandatory, you can use a barcode scanner to scan your product’s barcode into this field! Then, when you\nSell This Product\n, you can scan the barcode into Jane to quickly check out your customer:\nDescription\nThe Description Field also allows you to add extra detailed notes to show up on the receipt for that product:\nReorder Threshold\nThe reorder threshold will trigger the product to appear on your\nInventory Report\norder list when the stock is one less than the threshold. This allows you to list a product without a quantity for items that are a special order.\n💡\nJane Tip:\nThe Reorder Threshold applies to each location individually. For example, if your yoga mat Reorder Threshold is 5, and you have 35 yoga mats at the Village but only 4 at the District, your Inventory Report will show that you need to reorder yoga mats for the District only.\nViewing the Log of Changes for a Product\nNeed to keep tabs on your ever-changing inventory? Jane keeps track of everything - recording every last change\nNOTE\n📍:\nSince this is a clinic-wide setting, only users with\nFull Access\nto the account can view this area. Check out our guide on\nStaff Access Levels\nfor more details.\nTo start, you’ll want to head over to the\nSettings\ntab and select\nProducts\nfrom the left sidebar menu. You can browse the page for the desired product inventory you need to investigate. Alternatively, you can use the search bar to help narrow down the options.\nFrom here, you can click on the blue\nView Log\ntext under the\nInventory\ncolumn.\nThis log will show a list of when inventory increased or decreased. Additionally, you’ll be able to see the reason for the change, any notes from your lovely staff and the date those actions took place - all in one go.\nIf you’d like to see a bit more details for a purchase, click on the blue\nCreated Purchase\ntext. Jane will redirect you straight to the invoice for a little extra sleuthing 🔍\nHow to archive a Product:\nFrom time to time, you may need need to delete a Product from the Product List so it’s no longer part of your inventory. To do so, you can archive a Product.\nTo archive a Product, head to\nSettings\nin the blue banner at the top of your Jane page, click on\nProducts\nin the left sidebar menu, find the Product in the list, and click\nEdit\n.\nScroll to the bottom of the Product page and click the\nArchive\nbutton.\nYou can view archived Products, as well as unarchive them, by heading to\nSettings\n, then to\nProducts\n, and then clicking the\nShow Archived\nbutton at the top of the page.\nArchived products will be displayed with a grey\nArchived\nbadge. You can click\nEdit\nto view the Product details, and you can also click the blue\nSave & Unarchive\nbutton if needed.\n💡\nJane tip\n: the Products List can be accessed by staff members with billing access, including the Administrative / All Billing, Full Access, and Account Owner\nstaff access levels\n.\nAdditional Notes & FAQ\nHow can I view a list of products that have tax added to them?\nA staff member with\nFull Access\ncan head over to the\nSettings\ntab and click on\nProducts\nwithin the left sidebar menu. Jane will display a list of all the products, including a column with which tax has been added.\nIf you’d like to learn more about pulling a product list in Jane, check out our\nThe Inventory Report, Product Price Lists and Calculating Retail Value\nguide for more details.\nNext up, click here to learn how to\nSell a Product\n!\nIf you have questions, or if you want to chat through workflows in Jane, please don’t hesitate to\nget in touch\n, we’re always happy to hear from you. 💙Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.\n500 - 138 13th Street East, North Vancouver\nBritish Columbia, Canada V7L 0E5\nContact Us\n+1 844-310-JANE (5263)\n+44 808 164 0893\n+61 1 800 940 893\n+1 604-670-JANE (5263)\nseejanerun@janeapp.com\nWant to keep up-to-date with everything that’s new in Jane?
