In Jane, we call these Adjustments. Here’s how you can use them:\nCreating an Adjustment or Price Discount\nAdding the Adjustment or Price Discount to an Invoice\nEditing an Adjustment or Price Discount for a Specific Appointment\nTracking Adjustments or Price Discounts with Jane Reports\nFAQ\nCreate an Adjustment\nTo create a new type of Adjustment,  a staff member with\nFull Access\ncan head over to your\nSettings\ntab and choose\nAdjustments\nfrom the list on the left.\nClick\nNew Adjustment\nat the top right and then begin by labelling your new adjustment.\nAdjustment Type\nOverride\nwill completely replace the price of the treatment with whatever you choose as the override amount.  So if you set a $25 override on a $125 treatment, the visit will now be $25.\nPercent Discount\nwill reduce the cost by whatever percentage you enter.  So a 10% discount will drop a $100 visit to $90 and a $50 visit to $45.\nDollar Discount\nwill reduce the cost by whatever dollar amount you enter.  So a $20 discount will drop a $100 visit to $80 and a $50 visit to $30.\nProvider of Discount\nClinic & Staff Member\nwill reduce the price of this visit on the compensation report to the adjusted value.  So if a $100 visit is reduced to $50 then the staff member will be compensated for $50.\nClinic Only\nwill not reduce the price of this visit on the compensation report to the adjusted value.  So if a $100 visit is reduced to $50 then the staff member will be compensated for the full $100 as if the full amount had been charged. This will also trigger the\nProvided by Company (Owed to Staff Member)\nline item to populate in your\nCompensation Report\n, to make note of this change, and what the clinic would owe the practitioner.\nAdding the Adjustment or Price Discount to an Invoice\nFrom the Schedule\nTo adjust billing by adding an adjustment or discount to a treatment:\nClick on the appointment in your\nSchedule\nto open the\nAppointment Panel\nUnder\nBilling Info\nclick on the blue\nAdjustment\nbutton\nType in the name of your discount and select it from the menu to add the discount to your treatment\n💡\nPro-tip\n: If you don’t remember the name of the adjustment or discount, you can hit the spacebar on your keyboard and Jane will populate a list of all the discounts and adjustments created under the clinic-wide settings.\nNote📝\n: All Adjustments are applied to the Pre-Insured and Pre-Tax amounts. There currently isn’t a way to have this set so it’s applied to the final invoice total. So, if you are discounting a service, this discount will be applied to the price of the visit as a whole, and then the insurer portion will be calculated.  This is to ensure that insured percentages are being honoured.\nFrom the Patient Profile\nIf the invoice is already created, you can add an adjustment or price discount by heading over to the\nPatient\nor\nClient’s\nprofile, and then on the\nBilling\ntab within the profile. Jane will display a list of all the invoices created for them.\nYou’ll want to click on the word\nView\nto the far right of the desired invoice line:\nFrom there, scroll down to the\nAdjustments\nsection and type in the name of the adjustment or price discount:\nDiscounts for Product Sales\nIf you’re looking to add a discount to a product invoice, you’ll want to head over to the\nPatient’s Profile\n, and click on the\nBilling\ntab. From there, find the product invoice and click on the word\nView\nto the far right of the invoice line.\nNext, scroll down to the\nAdjustments\nsection and type in the name of the discount that you’d like to add.\nFor products sold through the\nSchedule\n, you can add the adjustment by clicking on the blue\nAdjustment\nbutton within the\nBilling Info\nsection of the\nAppointment Panel\nafter the product is sold.\nDefault Adjustments and Price Adjustments\nOnce your Adjustments and/or Price Discounts have been set up, you can assign it as a default to an existing patient profile. This way, the Adjustment is automatically applied to all upcoming appointments and purchases for this patient. This nifty feature automates a sometimes tedious task, saving your team some time from having to manually edit those invoices to give them a recurring discount.\nLike a load off, right? 😌\nTo add a default Adjustment, head over to the\nPatients\nor\nClients\ntab in the top menu, and then click the patient’s name from the left side. With their profile opened up, you’ll see a\nDefault Adjustment\nheading on the lower right side.\nClick\n+Add\nand choose the appropriate Adjustment from the list.\nThe Adjustment will then appear in the\nBilling Info\nsection of the patient’s future appointments and generate those discounted invoices automatically.\nEditing an Adjustment for a Specific Appointment\nIf you need to remove the Adjustment from a specific appointment, you can do so using the blue X next to the Adjustment name in the Billing Info section. Removing it from a single appointment will not affect future appointments if you have a default Adjustment set up for a patient.\nAt any point, you can also override the discount to a different amount: Once the Adjustment is applied to the appointment, you can click\ndirectly on the name\nof the Adjustment to open up an Edit window.\nFrom here, you can change the type of Adjustment, the Value, and the Provider.\nReporting\nFind the Adjustment report in your\nReports\ntab.\nYou can report on Adjustments by location, staff member and date range.\nHelpful in finding out how much value you’ve given away through your different promotions or Adjustments.\nLet us know if you need any further direction with working with Adjustments in Jane!\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWho can create adjustments?\nOnly a profile set to\nFull Access\ncan create new adjustments in Jane. To learn more, check out Jane’s\nStaff Access Levels\nguide.\nWho can change an adjustment?\nTo provide day-to-day flexibility, all staff members can “edit” the value of an adjustment once it’s added to an invoice. Any changes will only affect that one invoice though — to change the default settings of an adjustment, an\nFull Access\nusers can go to\nSettings\n>\nAdjustments\nto modify it.\nWhen should I use an Adjustment?\nAdjustments in Jane can be used for things like:\nEarly bird rates\nSpecial promotions\nFriends and family discounts\nFree services\nSliding scale pricing\nLegacy pricing for existing customers\nWe recommend using Adjustments rather than manually editing the price of an invoice because you can more easily track these price changes with the Adjustments Report.\nThe provider of the discount was set to the wrong method by mistake, how do I change the settings?\nIf you need to modify how your adjustments are set up, you can do so under the Adjustments area in Settings, where we had originally set it up.\nIt’s worth noting that if you make a change to an adjustment from this area, this change will apply to any time this adjustment is added moving forward – but Jane has safeguards to protect previously generated invoices and as such, existing invoices will not be affected.\n💡Pro Tip:\nIf you need an updated Adjustment to be reflected on a previously generated invoice, you can remove the adjustment by clicking the “x” on the purchase and re-add it.\nAre default price Adjustments applied to Group Appointments?\nYes, under one condition. If the Primary Client has a default price Adjustment on their profile (for example, a sliding scale arrangement), then that Adjustment will be applied to the cost of their Group Appointment. Price Adjustments on\nSecondary Clients’\nprofiles\nwill not\nbe applied to Group Appointments.\nCan I use an adjustment to set a specific price for one patient?\nYes\n- you’ll still want to set up the adjustment over in the\nSettings\ntab >\nAdjustments\narea so that you can add a default adjustment to their profile. Since default adjustments are applied to all invoices generated under this patient’s profile, this is a great way to set a specific price for that patient.\nIs there a way to print out all patients who have a default adjustment on file?\nNo\n- at the moment there isn’t a separate report that you can print or export to generate a list of all the patients that have a default adjustment added to their profile. However, you can use the\nAdjustments\nreport within the\nReports\ntab.\nWith the Detail filter toggled on, Jane will list all the invoices that have an adjustment added to them. Additionally, you’ll be able to see the name of the patient and the adjustment that was added.\nYou can print this off or further customize the data in Excel. For more information on that process, you can check out our\nExporting Reports and Customizing them in Excel\nfor more tips and tricks.\nIs there a way to show the original price on a receipt after an adjustment/discount is applied?\nYup - and you have two options:\nSchedule\nHead over to the\nSchedule\nand click on the appointment. Within the\nAppointment Panel\n, you’ll want to click on the\ndropdown arrow\nto the right of the word\nPay\nand select one of the\nReceipt (Detailed)\noptions in the Print, Email, or PDF sections within the\ndropdown\nmenu.\nPatient Profile\nOpen up the patient’s profile, click on the\nBilling\ntab, and by default, Jane lands on\nPurchases\n. You’ll want to find the invoice and click on the\ndropdown arrow\nto the right of the word\nView\n. Next, select one of the\nReceipt (Detailed)\noptions to print, email, or save a PDF of the receipt.\nPro-tip\n💡:\nHitting\nPrint Receipt (Detailed)\ndoesn’t print the document right away. Jane will open up a preview screen where you can select a different option if you change your mind or would just like to take a peek at what your patients would see.\nOf course, if you have any additional questions around discounts or adjustments that weren’t covered in this guide, feel free to reach out to our team directly!\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter.\nWelcome\nWelcome to the Jane Guide\nCode of Conduct\nFeature Requests\nJane's Brand Assets\nAccount Setup Consultations\nWhat's new in Jane?\nWhat's new in Jane Webinar\nJane's Changelog\nJane's Monthly Newsletter\nUpdates to Interchange Fees for Visa & Mastercard in Canada 🇨🇦\nHoward Spector joins Jane!\nJane Appoints Dan Davidow as Chief Marketing Officer\nJane App's Support Team Wins a Bronze Stevie® Award\nDemo Videos\nPractitioner's Home Base: Day Sheets & Charts\nJane in Action\nPractitioner Training:  Initial Signing In and Overview\nInsurance: Billing a Visit to a 3rd Party\nScheduling: Managing the Schedule with Many Practitioners\nDisciplines, Treatments, & Billing Settings\nSetting up Staff & Scheduling Shifts\nCharting: Signing, Duplicating & Symbols\nScheduling: Complete Schedule Overview\nBilling: Accepting Payments\nLaunching an Insurer Portal\nQuick Start\nStep 1: Clinic Information\nStep 2: Disciplines\nStep 3: Treatments\nStep 4: Staff\nStep 5: Schedule or Diary\nAdditional Set Up Recommendations\nPractitioner Step 1: Practitioner Training\nPractitioner Step 2: Treatments\nPractitioner Step 3: Shifts\nPractitioner Step 4: Online Booking\nPractitioner Step 5: Charting\nAccount Setup Consultations\nSwitching to Jane\nSwitching is easy with Jane on your team\nJane vs. SimplePractice\nAccount Basics\nHow To Check Who's Listed As Account Owner\nChecklist for Starting with Jane\nBrowser Requirements\nDevice & Network Recommendations\nUsing Jane on a Tablet\nUsing Jane on a Smartphone\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nAuto-Logout Duration\nUpdating Your Clinic Email Address & Phone Number\nLog In Help: Username and Password\nEnabling Patient Self Check-in\nAdding a Location\nBooking  a Break on a Mobile Device (Phone or other Small Screen)\nMoving Your Practice to a New Location\nMultiple Locations or Multiple Accounts: How to Set Up Jane for Independent Locations or Practitioners\nAccessibility in Jane\nI Can't Access My Jane Account: A Troubleshooting Guide\nHow to Archive a Treatment, Class or Group Appointment\nBookmarking Your Jane Account for Easy Access\nViewing Protected Financial Documents (For Patients)\nSwitching to the Balance Plan\nAdding a Billing Address for Locations\nUnauthorized Access: What to Do if Your Laptop/Phone is Lost or Stolen\nHow to Archive/Unarchive a Discipline\nHow to Change the Name of Your Clinic\nImporting to Jane\nHow to Import Data to Jane (Overview)\nBasics of Importing to Jane\nDiving Deeper Into Importing to Jane\nWhere Can You Import From?

In Jane, we call these Adjustments. Here’s how you can use them:\nCreating an Adjustment or Price Discount\nAdding the Adjustment or Price Discount to an Invoice\nEditing an Adjustment or Price Discount for a Specific Appointment\nTracking Adjustments or Price Discounts with Jane Reports\nFAQ\nCreate an Adjustment\nTo create a new type of Adjustment,  a staff member with\nFull Access\ncan head over to your\nSettings\ntab and choose\nAdjustments\nfrom the list on the left.\nClick\nNew Adjustment\nat the top right and then begin by labelling your new adjustment.\nAdjustment Type\nOverride\nwill completely replace the price of the treatment with whatever you choose as the override amount.  So if you set a $25 override on a $125 treatment, the visit will now be $25.\nPercent Discount\nwill reduce the cost by whatever percentage you enter.  So a 10% discount will drop a $100 visit to $90 and a $50 visit to $45.\nDollar Discount\nwill reduce the cost by whatever dollar amount you enter.  So a $20 discount will drop a $100 visit to $80 and a $50 visit to $30.\nProvider of Discount\nClinic & Staff Member\nwill reduce the price of this visit on the compensation report to the adjusted value.  So if a $100 visit is reduced to $50 then the staff member will be compensated for $50.\nClinic Only\nwill not reduce the price of this visit on the compensation report to the adjusted value.  So if a $100 visit is reduced to $50 then the staff member will be compensated for the full $100 as if the full amount had been charged. This will also trigger the\nProvided by Company (Owed to Staff Member)\nline item to populate in your\nCompensation Report\n, to make note of this change, and what the clinic would owe the practitioner.\nAdding the Adjustment or Price Discount to an Invoice\nFrom the Schedule\nTo adjust billing by adding an adjustment or discount to a treatment:\nClick on the appointment in your\nSchedule\nto open the\nAppointment Panel\nUnder\nBilling Info\nclick on the blue\nAdjustment\nbutton\nType in the name of your discount and select it from the menu to add the discount to your treatment\n💡\nPro-tip\n: If you don’t remember the name of the adjustment or discount, you can hit the spacebar on your keyboard and Jane will populate a list of all the discounts and adjustments created under the clinic-wide settings.\nNote📝\n: All Adjustments are applied to the Pre-Insured and Pre-Tax amounts. There currently isn’t a way to have this set so it’s applied to the final invoice total. So, if you are discounting a service, this discount will be applied to the price of the visit as a whole, and then the insurer portion will be calculated.  This is to ensure that insured percentages are being honoured.\nFrom the Patient Profile\nIf the invoice is already created, you can add an adjustment or price discount by heading over to the\nPatient\nor\nClient’s\nprofile, and then on the\nBilling\ntab within the profile. Jane will display a list of all the invoices created for them.\nYou’ll want to click on the word\nView\nto the far right of the desired invoice line:\nFrom there, scroll down to the\nAdjustments\nsection and type in the name of the adjustment or price discount:\nDiscounts for Product Sales\nIf you’re looking to add a discount to a product invoice, you’ll want to head over to the\nPatient’s Profile\n, and click on the\nBilling\ntab. From there, find the product invoice and click on the word\nView\nto the far right of the invoice line.\nNext, scroll down to the\nAdjustments\nsection and type in the name of the discount that you’d like to add.\nFor products sold through the\nSchedule\n, you can add the adjustment by clicking on the blue\nAdjustment\nbutton within the\nBilling Info\nsection of the\nAppointment Panel\nafter the product is sold.\nDefault Adjustments and Price Adjustments\nOnce your Adjustments and/or Price Discounts have been set up, you can assign it as a default to an existing patient profile. This way, the Adjustment is automatically applied to all upcoming appointments and purchases for this patient. This nifty feature automates a sometimes tedious task, saving your team some time from having to manually edit those invoices to give them a recurring discount.\nLike a load off, right? 😌\nTo add a default Adjustment, head over to the\nPatients\nor\nClients\ntab in the top menu, and then click the patient’s name from the left side. With their profile opened up, you’ll see a\nDefault Adjustment\nheading on the lower right side.\nClick\n+Add\nand choose the appropriate Adjustment from the list.\nThe Adjustment will then appear in the\nBilling Info\nsection of the patient’s future appointments and generate those discounted invoices automatically.\nEditing an Adjustment for a Specific Appointment\nIf you need to remove the Adjustment from a specific appointment, you can do so using the blue X next to the Adjustment name in the Billing Info section. Removing it from a single appointment will not affect future appointments if you have a default Adjustment set up for a patient.\nAt any point, you can also override the discount to a different amount: Once the Adjustment is applied to the appointment, you can click\ndirectly on the name\nof the Adjustment to open up an Edit window.\nFrom here, you can change the type of Adjustment, the Value, and the Provider.\nReporting\nFind the Adjustment report in your\nReports\ntab.\nYou can report on Adjustments by location, staff member and date range.\nHelpful in finding out how much value you’ve given away through your different promotions or Adjustments.\nLet us know if you need any further direction with working with Adjustments in Jane!\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWho can create adjustments?\nOnly a profile set to\nFull Access\ncan create new adjustments in Jane. To learn more, check out Jane’s\nStaff Access Levels\nguide.\nWho can change an adjustment?\nTo provide day-to-day flexibility, all staff members can “edit” the value of an adjustment once it’s added to an invoice. Any changes will only affect that one invoice though — to change the default settings of an adjustment, an\nFull Access\nusers can go to\nSettings\n>\nAdjustments\nto modify it.\nWhen should I use an Adjustment?\nAdjustments in Jane can be used for things like:\nEarly bird rates\nSpecial promotions\nFriends and family discounts\nFree services\nSliding scale pricing\nLegacy pricing for existing customers\nWe recommend using Adjustments rather than manually editing the price of an invoice because you can more easily track these price changes with the Adjustments Report.\nThe provider of the discount was set to the wrong method by mistake, how do I change the settings?\nIf you need to modify how your adjustments are set up, you can do so under the Adjustments area in Settings, where we had originally set it up.\nIt’s worth noting that if you make a change to an adjustment from this area, this change will apply to any time this adjustment is added moving forward – but Jane has safeguards to protect previously generated invoices and as such, existing invoices will not be affected.\n💡Pro Tip:\nIf you need an updated Adjustment to be reflected on a previously generated invoice, you can remove the adjustment by clicking the “x” on the purchase and re-add it.\nAre default price Adjustments applied to Group Appointments?\nYes, under one condition. If the Primary Client has a default price Adjustment on their profile (for example, a sliding scale arrangement), then that Adjustment will be applied to the cost of their Group Appointment. Price Adjustments on\nSecondary Clients’\nprofiles\nwill not\nbe applied to Group Appointments.\nCan I use an adjustment to set a specific price for one patient?\nYes\n- you’ll still want to set up the adjustment over in the\nSettings\ntab >\nAdjustments\narea so that you can add a default adjustment to their profile. Since default adjustments are applied to all invoices generated under this patient’s profile, this is a great way to set a specific price for that patient.\nIs there a way to print out all patients who have a default adjustment on file?\nNo\n- at the moment there isn’t a separate report that you can print or export to generate a list of all the patients that have a default adjustment added to their profile. However, you can use the\nAdjustments\nreport within the\nReports\ntab.\nWith the Detail filter toggled on, Jane will list all the invoices that have an adjustment added to them. Additionally, you’ll be able to see the name of the patient and the adjustment that was added.\nYou can print this off or further customize the data in Excel. For more information on that process, you can check out our\nExporting Reports and Customizing them in Excel\nfor more tips and tricks.\nIs there a way to show the original price on a receipt after an adjustment/discount is applied?\nYup - and you have two options:\nSchedule\nHead over to the\nSchedule\nand click on the appointment. Within the\nAppointment Panel\n, you’ll want to click on the\ndropdown arrow\nto the right of the word\nPay\nand select one of the\nReceipt (Detailed)\noptions in the Print, Email, or PDF sections within the\ndropdown\nmenu.\nPatient Profile\nOpen up the patient’s profile, click on the\nBilling\ntab, and by default, Jane lands on\nPurchases\n. You’ll want to find the invoice and click on the\ndropdown arrow\nto the right of the word\nView\n. Next, select one of the\nReceipt (Detailed)\noptions to print, email, or save a PDF of the receipt.\nPro-tip\n💡:\nHitting\nPrint Receipt (Detailed)\ndoesn’t print the document right away. Jane will open up a preview screen where you can select a different option if you change your mind or would just like to take a peek at what your patients would see.\nOf course, if you have any additional questions around discounts or adjustments that weren’t covered in this guide, feel free to reach out to our team directly!Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.\n500 - 138 13th Street East, North Vancouver\nBritish Columbia, Canada V7L 0E5\nContact Us\n+1 844-310-JANE (5263)\n+44 808 164 0893\n+61 1 800 940 893\n+1 604-670-JANE (5263)\nseejanerun@janeapp.com\nWant to keep up-to-date with everything that’s new in Jane?
