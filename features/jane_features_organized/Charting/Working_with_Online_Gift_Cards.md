users in 🇨🇦 Canada and 🇺🇸 the US. If you’re not signed up yet, you can learn more about

when you’re ready!
This guide covers gift cards that clients can purchase
online
. If you’re curious about gift cards that clients can purchase administratively while at your clinic, our
Gift Card Overview
guide is a great place to start.
Did you know that the gift cards you know and love can now be purchased by clients online? Whether they want to treat themselves or a loved one, they can purchase a gift card and receive a code to share with the lucky gift recipient. 📩
This feature is a great way for smaller clinics that don’t have a third-party gift card system to attract new clients through gift-giving, and have a little extra income, too!
If you’d like a refresher on how our gift cards work, you can
read the overview here
.
Let’s get started!
Setting up Online Gift Cards
Adding a link to your website
Client experience: Purchasing a gift card
FAQ
Setting up Online Gift Cards
Setting up Online Gift Cards couldn’t be simpler. We’ll head to
Settings
on the top bar of Jane and select
Billing Settings
on the left menu:
In the
Gift Cards
section, we have four settings to look at.
The first checkbox simply enables Gift Cards for your Jane account (to be sold administratively).
The second setting allows clients to purchase gift cards online.
If your clinic doesn’t offer online booking, your clients will still be able to purchase gift cards with this setting enabled.
The third setting is the maximum amount that you or your staff can be loaded onto a gift card.
The fourth setting is the maximum amount a patient or other customer can purchase when buying a gift card online. Please note, there is a mandatory $10 minimum for gift cards.
Once you’re happy with the settings you’ve chosen, you can click
Save Billing Information
at the bottom of the screen.
We’re finished setting up! 🎉
Adding a link to your website
If you want to get fancy, you can embed the link to purchase gift cards on your own website. You can head to
Settings
on the top bar of Jane, then
Billing Settings
on the left:
Next, you can scroll down to the
Gift Cards section
and copy the link there to use on your external website or on social media:
Here’s what it looks like when someone follows that link and they aren’t signed in:

Fantastic! Let’s take a look at the client’s experience of purchasing a gift card online.
Client experience: Purchasing a gift card
There are three different ways that a client can find your Gift Card purchase page:
By clicking on your gift card link that you post on social media or embed in your external website. (Check out the previous section for details.)
By clicking the
Buy a gift card
link on your Thanks for Booking page.
By following the link on the sidebar of your Online Booking page.
Let’s walk through what it looks like to purchase a gift card from the sidebar of your Online Booking page.
When a client visits your online booking site, they’ll see a
Buy Gift Card
button to the left of the page.
Please note, if you have more than one location listed on your online booking site, the client will need to choose a location before they see the button.
This is just part of our site design, but clients will still be able to redeem their gift card at any of your clinic locations.
Once your client clicks the
Buy Gift Card
button, they’ll see the message below and they can click
Sign In To Buy Gift Card.
Next, they’ll come to the page below where they can view the price list of your shared services available for online booking. If your services don’t include tax in the price listed online, then clients will see the service subtotal. This gives them an idea of how much to load the card with in order to gift someone a specific service.
They can sign in (if they aren’t already) or create an account before completing their purchase.
The client can use any of their stored cards or add a new one and then click the Buy Gift Card button.
On the next screen, they’ll see the Gift Card code which they can give to the recipient. They can click the Send button and their default email program will open with a pre-populated message that they can edit.
Looking to create the gift card on behalf of a patient? You can head over to their

FAQ
Can anyone purchase a gift card without an account?
How does the gift card recipient get their code?
How can clients redeem online gift cards?
Can clients redeem gift cards online?
Where can clients see which gift cards they’ve purchased?
Can staff see a client’s gift card code from the admin side of Jane?
What payment methods are accepted to purchase gift cards?
My clinic has multiple Jane Payments accounts. Which one does the gift card sale get paid out to?
I’m a solo practitioner so I don’t have the same menu on my online booking site. How can I direct clients to the link to buy a gift card?
Can a gift card be reloaded online?
Why would I want the option to set two different caps for the Gift Card load limit and Gift card online sale limit?
Is there a way to add an expiry date to a gift card?
Can anyone purchase a gift card without an account?
Very good question. As a security measure, customers must create an account (if they don’t already have one) prior to purchasing a gift card. This also means that if they lose track of the code for their gift card, they can log into their account to find it.
How does the gift card recipient get their code?
The person who purchased the gift card will see a Send button on the final screen after completing their purchase. This button opens up their email with a pre-populated message they can edit if they like before sending the Gift Card redemption code.
How can clients redeem online gift cards?
Clients can redeem online gift cards the same way as gift cards purchased administratively. Check out this guide on
Redeeming a Gift Card
for step-by-step instructions. 🙂
Can clients redeem gift cards online?
Gift cards cannot be redeemed online when patients book appointments, and at this time there is no option to purchase products through the patient’s facing side. However, if the patient would like to redeem their gift card, they can provide the gift card code to the clinic, or the clinic can look up the patient’s profile and the gift cards under their billing.
Where can clients see which gift cards they’ve purchased?
Clients can see gift cards they’ve purchased on their
My Account
page by selecting
Gift Cards
on the menu to the left. They can also find the gift card redemption codes here too.
Jane tip: Gift cards purchased
administratively
will not show up in a client’s
My Account
area.
Can staff see a client’s gift card code from the admin side of Jane?
Yes, staff can view the gift cards and redemption codes that a client has purchased from their
Billing tab
under
Gift Cards
:
What payment methods are accepted to purchase gift cards?
Because gift cards purchased online must be done through the Jane Payments integration, clients can pay by credit card. For online transactions, Jane Payments accepts Amex, Visa, Visa Debit, Mastercard, Debit Mastercard, Discover, Diner Club, and UnionPay.
My clinic has multiple Jane Payments accounts. Which one does the gift card sale get paid out to?
Excellent question! When a gift card is purchased, that money is deposited into the
last used
Jane Payments account. At the moment, Jane does not currently have the ability to choose which Jane Payments account the funds are deposited into.
If your clinic has multiple Jane Payments Accounts and you’d like to use our Online Gift Card feature, an option here would be to track those gift card sales so that you can manually compensate a practitioner if needed.
To view gift card sales, a user with
Administrative / All Billing
access can head over to the
Reports
tab within the top blue banner, scroll down to
Billing
, and select
Gift Cards:
This report will show us gift cards that have been purchased administratively and online. If we’re only concerned with tracking online gift card sales, we want to look for any gift cards with the following format:
JOHN_SMITH_123_12345
. All gift cards purchased online will have that same format.
In the example below, the card on top was bought online, and the card on the bottom was bought administratively:
For this option, you would want to keep a close watch on the
Gift Cards
report, see which account the funds were deposited to and then collaborate with staff if funds need to be moved around.
I’m a solo practitioner so I don’t have the same menu on my online booking site. How can I direct clients to the link to buy a gift card?
Great question! You’re right that solo practitioners don’t have the menu on the left of their online booking site,  so you have a couple of options.
Your existing clients will see the link to purchase a gift card after making an appointment on the Thanks For Booking page:
You can also follow
the steps here
to direct clients to your gift card page.
First, you can head to Settings > Billing Settings:
Then you can copy the link to your Gift Card page:
You can paste that link into your
Notice/Message on Online booking Pages
area.
Can a gift card be reloaded online?
Not at this time, though gift cards can be reloaded administratively for a client.
Why would I want the option to set two different caps for the Gift Card load limit and Gift card online sale limit?
Jane has lots of safeguards in place, but whenever gift cards are available there is some risk of bad actors trying to exploit them. By allowing you to set different limits for Gift Card purchases made online and administratively, you have more control over that risk.
Ex. You could choose to allow Gift Cards to be sold/topped up in-person or over the phone for up to $2000, but reduce your Online Gift Card purchase limit to $200.
Is there a way to add an expiry date to a gift card?
No
- currently there isn’t a way to add an expiry date to a gift card in Jane. However, you are able to add a note by heading over to the
Gift Cards/Certificates
area of the
Billing
tab and then click on
View
to the right.

This guide covers gift cards that clients can purchase
online
. If you’re curious about gift cards that clients can purchase administratively while at your clinic, our
Gift Card Overview
guide is a great place to start.
Did you know that the gift cards you know and love can now be purchased by clients online? Whether they want to treat themselves or a loved one, they can purchase a gift card and receive a code to share with the lucky gift recipient. 📩
This feature is a great way for smaller clinics that don’t have a third-party gift card system to attract new clients through gift-giving, and have a little extra income, too!
If you’d like a refresher on how our gift cards work, you can
read the overview here
.
Let’s get started!
Setting up Online Gift Cards
Adding a link to your website
Client experience: Purchasing a gift card
FAQ
Setting up Online Gift Cards
Setting up Online Gift Cards couldn’t be simpler. We’ll head to
Settings
on the top bar of Jane and select
Billing Settings
on the left menu:
In the
Gift Cards
section, we have four settings to look at.
The first checkbox simply enables Gift Cards for your Jane account (to be sold administratively).
The second setting allows clients to purchase gift cards online.
If your clinic doesn’t offer online booking, your clients will still be able to purchase gift cards with this setting enabled.
The third setting is the maximum amount that you or your staff can be loaded onto a gift card.
The fourth setting is the maximum amount a patient or other customer can purchase when buying a gift card online. Please note, there is a mandatory $10 minimum for gift cards.
Once you’re happy with the settings you’ve chosen, you can click
Save Billing Information
at the bottom of the screen.
We’re finished setting up! 🎉
Adding a link to your website
If you want to get fancy, you can embed the link to purchase gift cards on your own website. You can head to
Settings
on the top bar of Jane, then
Billing Settings
on the left:
Next, you can scroll down to the
Gift Cards section
and copy the link there to use on your external website or on social media:
Here’s what it looks like when someone follows that link and they aren’t signed in:
And here’s what it looks like when someone follows the link and they are signed in:
Fantastic! Let’s take a look at the client’s experience of purchasing a gift card online.
Client experience: Purchasing a gift card
There are three different ways that a client can find your Gift Card purchase page:
By clicking on your gift card link that you post on social media or embed in your external website. (Check out the previous section for details.)
By clicking the
Buy a gift card
link on your Thanks for Booking page.
By following the link on the sidebar of your Online Booking page.
Let’s walk through what it looks like to purchase a gift card from the sidebar of your Online Booking page.
When a client visits your online booking site, they’ll see a
Buy Gift Card
button to the left of the page.
Please note, if you have more than one location listed on your online booking site, the client will need to choose a location before they see the button.
This is just part of our site design, but clients will still be able to redeem their gift card at any of your clinic locations.
Once your client clicks the
Buy Gift Card
button, they’ll see the message below and they can click
Sign In To Buy Gift Card.
Next, they’ll come to the page below where they can view the price list of your shared services available for online booking. If your services don’t include tax in the price listed online, then clients will see the service subtotal. This gives them an idea of how much to load the card with in order to gift someone a specific service.
They can sign in (if they aren’t already) or create an account before completing their purchase.
The client can use any of their stored cards or add a new one and then click the Buy Gift Card button.
On the next screen, they’ll see the Gift Card code which they can give to the recipient. They can click the Send button and their default email program will open with a pre-populated message that they can edit.

FAQ
Can anyone purchase a gift card without an account?
How does the gift card recipient get their code?
How can clients redeem online gift cards?
Can clients redeem gift cards online?
Where can clients see which gift cards they’ve purchased?
Can staff see a client’s gift card code from the admin side of Jane?
What payment methods are accepted to purchase gift cards?
My clinic has multiple Jane Payments accounts. Which one does the gift card sale get paid out to?
I’m a solo practitioner so I don’t have the same menu on my online booking site. How can I direct clients to the link to buy a gift card?
Can a gift card be reloaded online?
Why would I want the option to set two different caps for the Gift Card load limit and Gift card online sale limit?
Is there a way to add an expiry date to a gift card?
Can anyone purchase a gift card without an account?
Very good question. As a security measure, customers must create an account (if they don’t already have one) prior to purchasing a gift card. This also means that if they lose track of the code for their gift card, they can log into their account to find it.
How does the gift card recipient get their code?
The person who purchased the gift card will see a Send button on the final screen after completing their purchase. This button opens up their email with a pre-populated message they can edit if they like before sending the Gift Card redemption code.
How can clients redeem online gift cards?
Clients can redeem online gift cards the same way as gift cards purchased administratively. Check out this guide on
Redeeming a Gift Card
for step-by-step instructions. 🙂
Can clients redeem gift cards online?
Gift cards cannot be redeemed online when patients book appointments, and at this time there is no option to purchase products through the patient’s facing side. However, if the patient would like to redeem their gift card, they can provide the gift card code to the clinic, or the clinic can look up the patient’s profile and the gift cards under their billing.
Where can clients see which gift cards they’ve purchased?
Clients can see gift cards they’ve purchased on their
My Account
page by selecting
Gift Cards
on the menu to the left. They can also find the gift card redemption codes here too.
Jane tip: Gift cards purchased
administratively
will not show up in a client’s
My Account
area.
Can staff see a client’s gift card code from the admin side of Jane?
Yes, staff can view the gift cards and redemption codes that a client has purchased from their
Billing tab
under
Gift Cards
:
What payment methods are accepted to purchase gift cards?
Because gift cards purchased online must be done through the Jane Payments integration, clients can pay by credit card. For online transactions, Jane Payments accepts Amex, Visa, Visa Debit, Mastercard, Debit Mastercard, Discover, Diner Club, and UnionPay.
My clinic has multiple Jane Payments accounts. Which one does the gift card sale get paid out to?
Excellent question! When a gift card is purchased, that money is deposited into the
last used
Jane Payments account. At the moment, Jane does not currently have the ability to choose which Jane Payments account the funds are deposited into.
If your clinic has multiple Jane Payments Accounts and you’d like to use our Online Gift Card feature, an option here would be to track those gift card sales so that you can manually compensate a practitioner if needed.
To view gift card sales, a user with
Administrative / All Billing
access can head over to the
Reports
tab within the top blue banner, scroll down to
Billing
, and select
Gift Cards:
This report will show us gift cards that have been purchased administratively and online. If we’re only concerned with tracking online gift card sales, we want to look for any gift cards with the following format:
JOHN_SMITH_123_12345
. All gift cards purchased online will have that same format.
In the example below, the card on top was bought online, and the card on the bottom was bought administratively:
For this option, you would want to keep a close watch on the
Gift Cards
report, see which account the funds were deposited to and then collaborate with staff if funds need to be moved around.
I’m a solo practitioner so I don’t have the same menu on my online booking site. How can I direct clients to the link to buy a gift card?
Great question! You’re right that solo practitioners don’t have the menu on the left of their online booking site,  so you have a couple of options.
Your existing clients will see the link to purchase a gift card after making an appointment on the Thanks For Booking page:
You can also follow
the steps here
to direct clients to your gift card page.
First, you can head to Settings > Billing Settings:
Then you can copy the link to your Gift Card page:
You can paste that link into your
Notice/Message on Online booking Pages
area.
Can a gift card be reloaded online?
Not at this time, though gift cards can be reloaded administratively for a client.
Why would I want the option to set two different caps for the Gift Card load limit and Gift card online sale limit?
Jane has lots of safeguards in place, but whenever gift cards are available there is some risk of bad actors trying to exploit them. By allowing you to set different limits for Gift Card purchases made online and administratively, you have more control over that risk.
Ex. You could choose to allow Gift Cards to be sold/topped up in-person or over the phone for up to $2000, but reduce your Online Gift Card purchase limit to $200.
Is there a way to add an expiry date to a gift card?
No
- currently there isn’t a way to add an expiry date to a gift card in Jane. However, you are able to add a note by heading over to the
Gift Cards/Certificates
area of the
Billing
tab and then click on
View
to the right.
