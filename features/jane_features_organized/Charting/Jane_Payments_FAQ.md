General Questions
How long is the contract term with Jane Payments?
Just like Jane, there are no contracts or fixed terms with Jane Payments.
What payment methods can Jane Payments accept?
Visa, Visa Debit, MasterCard, Debit Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, UnionPay, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and, if you have a Jane Payments Terminal, Interac Debit.
Can I accept CareCredit through Jane Payments?
Jane Payments does not support the original CareCredit financing card, which requires clinics to be enrolled directly with CareCredit and to process payments through their system.
However, if a client uses the
CareCredit Rewards Mastercard
; a standard credit card issued by Synchrony, it can be accepted through Jane Payments just like any other Mastercard.
In short, traditional CareCredit cards are not supported, but the Rewards Mastercard is.
How do I refund a transaction made through Jane Payments?
You can refund any transaction made through Jane Payments right in Jane, without your client being present. The only exception is if the payment was made on an Interac Debit card, which will need to be inserted into the Jane Payments Terminal first in order to process a refund. Please note, the original transaction fees will not be refunded.
Will Jane store my clients’ payment data?
No credit card data is stored in Jane. When you enter credit card information into Jane, Jane creates and keeps a token that can be used to reference that information. But the actual sensitive information is sent to and stored within our payment partner Stripe, which holds the highest security certification in the industry. 🔒
What’s that odd, small charge on my client’s credit card?
Your client may see a $1 or less “pending” charge on their credit card or bank statement when their card is added to their file. This is a temporary authorization charge which is used to ensure the card provided is valid and able to accept charges. These authorizations will drop off the patient’s card statement after a few days and may appear as long as 7 business days.
Clients are able to speak with their card issuer to confirm this is the case, as well as confirm when it is expected to drop off their statement if they have any concerns.
Why did my client’s card decline?
When you’re taking a payment using Jane Payments, we send a request to your client’s credit card issuer, who lets us know if it’s “Approved” or “Declined.” Whenever a credit card is declined, we often jump to conclusions and assume it’s due to insufficient funds (but that’s not usually the case). Jane tries to give you as much information as possible about why a transaction is declined, but often times, we don’t receive a lot of information about the “why” from your patient’s credit card provider.
If your client has ensured that their credit card is valid and should work, it would be best to have them call their credit card issuing bank or provider to ensure they’re not blocking or preventing the payment, and to make sure their billing address is up to date. We wish we could call them on your behalf, but they only speak to cardholders.

HSA/FSA Cards
Why did an unexpected error occur when charging my client’s card?
An “Unexpected Error” Occurred or “Something went wrong” When Using a Jane Payments Credit Card
When processing a credit card, if there is a message that pops up stating that
Something went wrong
or an
Unexpected Error
has come up, this is usually due to the patient’s bank needing additional authentication.
It would be best to recommend the patient reach out to their bank to see if they need to provide further verification. Once that has been confirmed, you can charge the credit card to go through successfully.
Note
: One of the most common reasons this happens is that the bank or credit card issuer needs the patient to complete the 3D Secure Authentication
.
How can I assign or unassign a practitioner to a payment account?
Assigning a practitioner to a payment account lets Jane know to process all online payments, such as those through pay balance requests or during online booking, to that practitioner.
By default, this will be set to “All Staff.” If you’re a solo practitioner, we’d recommend leaving this as “All Staff.” For multi practitioner clinics with two or more payment accounts, you’ll want to select the correct practitioner from the drop down menu.
Can a refund be processed if the original card used for payment has expired?
This depends on the bank! Most banks, if the patient or client is still with them, will just re-route the refund to the correct place, whether that’s the patients new credit card with the bank, or another space altogehter.
There is no way of knowing if this will occur, so the clinic can try to process the refund through the expired credit card. If you run into an error this means that the refund cannot go through, and the clinic would need to provide that refunded money to the clinic in other ways, like a cheque, Paypal or e-transfer.
Can I remove all patient credit card information at once?
No
, you would need to remove the credit card information from each patient’s profile individually, ensuring that you have the appropriate
access level
within Jane to do so.
How can I differentiate between a Jane Payments Terminal payment, and an Online Payments transaction?
This is best clarified by checking over your transactions under the clinic’s
Jane Payments Transaction
report, under the
Reports
tab.
⚠️ Accessing the Jane Payments Transaction report (and any report) requires the staff profile to have Administrative/All Staff or higher as their permission level. For a review of this and other permission levels in Jane, check out our guide here:
Staff Access Levels
.
Once in this report, set your date ranges for the transaction in question, and on the right you’ll see the following labels & tags:
Card on File (in blue)
= an Online Payment:
Terminal (in green)
= a Jane Payment Terminal payment:
For Canadian clinics,
Terminal - Interac (in pink)
= a Jane Payments Terminal payment processed through Interac debit:
How can I update the name that appears on a client’s statement when they’re charged?
To update this language, you’ll want to head over to the
Settings
tab, then within the left sidebar menu, select
Jane Payments
. From there, you’ll click on the
blue pencil icon
on the correct Jane Payments account.
From there, you can review or edit the
Statement Descriptor
field. Make sure to hit the blue
Save
button to confirm those changes.
NOTE
📍:
On the actual statement, the statement descriptor will have what is entered in the clinic’s account under Statement Descriptor and North Vancouver. This is because the transaction is processed through Jane and our business is located in North Vancouver. We are not able to change the location to the clinic’s actual location, but including the clinic’s name or an abbreviation may be helpful to clarify where the charge is coming from.
Why is my patient’s statement showing a different name than what is indicated under my Statement Descriptor settings?
If you’ve already confirmed that the
Statement Descriptor
is correctly entered, it’s important to note that banks and card issuers use several data points from a given transaction to determine which friendly name and logo to display. Since each bank does this differently, the behaviour is not consistent across all patients or banking systems.
Jane Payments settings do not have control over or have an impact on these mapping systems. The recommendation here would be for the clinic to reach out to that card issuer to get that incorrect merchant name or image mapping updated on their end.
Can appointments be booked with an expired card on file?
No
- If a patient’s saved credit has expired, and your clinic has their Online Booking Payment Policy set to require a credit card on file, a deposit, or full payment the patient will be asked to enter in a new credit card.
Can an existing Stripe account be linked to Jane?
No, a
Stripe Standard
account cannot be integrated with Jane.
If you already have a
Stripe Express
account through another platform, signing up for Jane Payments will create a second, separate Express account. Using the same email and phone number for both accounts will let you easily toggle between them in your Stripe dashboard.
What’s the difference between Stripe Express and Full accounts?
If you’re using Jane Payments in Canada or the U.S., you’ll be set up with a
Stripe Express account
which is integrated with your Jane account to give you all the features and real-time reporting that Jane has to offer. Jane manages the payout schedule and other configurations, so you can focus on what you do best—running your practice.
All other countries (where Stripe offers services) are set up with a
Stripe Standard Account
. Jane users can process payments within Jane but do not have all the same features and benefits that our North American folks get with an Express Account.
Are there fees for processing a refund through Jane Payments?
If you ever need to issue a refund through Jane Payments, there’s no extra fee to do so. However, the processing fee from the original transaction isn’t returned.
Here’s a quick look at the processing rates, depending on where your clinic is located:
🇨🇦
Canada
:
Online: 2.75% per transaction
Terminal: 2.50% per transaction, $0.10 for Interac Debit
🇺🇸
USA
:
Online: 2.85% + $0.25 per transaction
Terminal: 2.6% + $0.10 per transaction
The fees do not include any federal or provincial sales tax.
What is the hole with the headphone symbol one the side of the terminal for?
The headphone jack on the side of the terminal has no specific use and is non-functional currently.
Why am I receiving a “Your Card Does Not Support This Type of Purchase” error message?
This error is less common than a standard “Decline” and usually indicates that the transaction is being restricted by the cardholder’s bank or credit card issuer.
Often times, this is related to
Health Spending Account (HSA) cards
.
This can happen if the
Merchant Category Code (MCC)
associated with your Jane Payments account doesn’t match what the HSA card requires for eligible purchases. The MCC is a code that identifies your business type to the card issuer, and if it doesn’t align with the HSA card’s criteria, the transaction will fail with this error.
However, this error can also appear with non-HSA cards, depending on restrictions set by the cardholder’s bank. The recommendation here would be for the patient to reach out to their cardholder to see the limitations of their card set up.
How can I change my clinic’s MCC?
When you sign up for a Jane Payments account, we automatically set you up with
MCC 8099
. This is for Medical Services and Health Practitioners. If you’re not sure whether MCC 8099 is right for your business, it’s a good idea to review the primary services you offer and consult with the Jane Payments team, or your payment processor (if you’re not using Jane Payments), to confirm the most appropriate code, and have that updated for you.
Can I process international cards through Jane Payments?
Yes
, your patients can pay using credit cards from different countries (i.e. a patient has a Mexican credit card, but your clinic is based in Canada). The payment will be processed in the clinic’s local currency, and the funds will be deposited into the clinic’s bank account in the same currency. The processing fees are consistent, and you can find the current rates at
Jane Payments Rates
.
Afterward, the patient’s credit card company will convert the amount into their local currency (USD, MXN, GBP, etc.) for their credit card statement. Please note that some cardholders may incur a currency conversion fee, depending on their bank’s policies and the type of card they have.
Can I copy credit cards from one profile to another?
While there isn’t a way to copy credit card details from one profile to another, you can set up a
Relationship
between the two client or patient profiles.
Once the relationship is set up and you’ve selected the correct permissions, you can use a patient’s credit card to pay for another related patients outstanding balance. Check out our
Payments for Related Clients
for more details.
Payouts & Deposits
When do I get my Jane Payments deposits?
With Jane Payments, you’ll receive a deposit every business day on a two day rolling basis (so Monday’s transactions deposit on Wednesday morning, and Friday’s transactions deposit on Tuesday morning). Keep in mind if there is a federal holiday, it will be delayed by a business day (since a holiday isn’t one).
The cutoff time for Jane Payments is 11:59 pm ET / 8:59 pm PT. This means that all payments processed before 11:59 pm for our East Coasters and 8:59 pm for those of us out West will be deposited into your account at the same time. Say goodbye to having payments from the same calendar day split into two deposits on two separate days! We hope this helps make your bookkeeping a little easier.
There are a couple of reports in Jane that will help you track these payments and deposits, as well.
Head to the Reports tab and choose Jane Payments Transactions from the lefthand side. Here you can see all payments taken on the dates you’ve selected, as well as the patient name, how the transaction was taken, as well as your payment processing fees.
You can also click Jane Payments Payouts from the lefthand side, where you’ll see a list of all the payouts for the selected period of time, as well as any that are en route to your bank account.
What should I do if I have multiple practitioners that need to be paid out directly?
With Jane’s Online Payments, you can set up as many accounts as you need to pay out directly. When using a Jane Payments Terminal for in-person payments, all of your practitioners can use one terminal and be paid out individually. We know, it’s pretty magical! 💫 If you’d like to learn more,
this guide is for you
.
Are there any reports to help me keep track of staff transactions and payouts?
There sure are. Under the
Reports
tab, you’ll see the
Jane Payments Transactions
and
Jane Payments Payouts
reports, which give you real-time information about your transactions, processing fees, and deposits.
The Jane Payments Transactions report can be viewed by staff members with
Front Desk, Administrator / All Billing, or Full Access
and the Jane Payments Payouts report can be viewed by staff members with
Full Access
.
As with many other reports in Jane, you can print or export this information to a spreadsheet file by clicking on the
three horizontal black dots
, in case you’d like to pass it along to your bookkeeper, accountant or a practitioner with limited access.
If you have questions about reconciling your payouts with your bank statements, feel free to check out our guide
Investigating Your Jane Payments Payouts
, which goes over this topic in detail.
Processing Fees
What are the processing fees by country?
There are no monthly or annual fees with Jane Payments. You’ll only ever pay for what you process!
💃
🇨🇦 Canada:
Online: 2.75% per transaction
Terminal: 2.50% per transaction, $0.10 for Interac Debit
🇺🇸 USA:
Online: 2.85% + $0.25 per transaction
Terminal: 2.6% + $0.10 per transaction
The fees do not include any federal or provincial sales tax.
Jane Payments Terminal
How do I know whether or not the Jane Payments Terminal is a good fit for me?
If you’re unsure whether you need a Jane Payments Terminal or not, take our
Payment Personality Quiz
!
Do I need to have any hardware to process in-person payments?
If you’d like to collect payments in person, you’ll need the Jane Payments Terminal (which can be purchased directly in your account). Otherwise, you can process all your payments directly in Jane.
Pricing:
Canada: $279.00 + tax/shipping
US: $239.00 + tax/shipping
Does the Jane Payments Terminal save credit cards on file for future use?
It sure can! Clinics can optionally save a credit card on file when a client taps, swipes, or inserts their card into the Jane Payments Terminal. To learn more, check out our guide
Saving credit cards from the Jane Payments Terminal
.
Can my clients leave a tip?
You bet! Check out our guide to
Tips on the Jane Payments Terminal
to learn more.
Why is a tip shown as a credit on a patient’s account after payment is accepted through the terminal?
When a tip is received on the Jane Payments Terminal and applied to an invoice that is not assigned to a specific staff member, Jane does not know who should receive the tip. As a result, the tip appears as a credit on the patient’s account.
To resolve this issue,  you’ll want to walk through your regular workflow for receiving a payment or head to the patient’s profile. From there, you can click on the
Billing
tab within the profile, select
Payments
, and click on the blue
Receive Payment
button.
On the next page, click on the blue
Add a Tip
text to add the tip manually. You’ll want to ensure that you select the correct staff member’s name from the dropdown menu to whom the tip is intended and enter the total credit amount.
Click on the blue
Next
button at the bottom of the page and ensure the credit is selected as the payment method to complete. If the credit isn’t auto-populated, then you can click on the blue
Add Payment Method
text and select it within the window that opens.
Do I need internet/wifi to use the Jane Payments Terminal?
Yes, the Jane Payments terminal will require a strong, reliable internet or wifi connection to function. If you are a mobile clinic 🚙, we recommend reaching out with any questions before purchasing.
Can I use the Jane Payments Terminal to pay out to multiple bank accounts?
With the
Jane Payments Terminal
, you can link to each of your practitioner’s bank accounts to send them their payments directly. 💸 Yep, you heard that right, no need for multiple terminals.
Does a Jane Payments Terminal have a warranty?
Yes! When you purchase a Jane Payments Terminal, it comes with a one-year warranty.
Where can I find my receipt for the Jane Payments terminal purchase?
If you’re looking for a receipt for your terminal purchase, the listed
Account Owner
can send an email to
payments@jane.app
. Our Payments team will issue a receipt via the email listed in the Account Owner’s profile.
Can I return my Jane Payments Terminal?
Your Jane Payments (POS or point of sale) Terminal can be returned for a refund within the first
30 days
after placing your order. Unfortunately, we’re not able to accept returns after that date. Please reach out to the Jane Payments team at
payments@jane.app
with the reason for the return to start the process.
Is there a way to connect an external card reader (or POS) to Jane?
No
, currently we only support the Jane Payments terminal and there isn’t a way to connect or integrate an external terminal to Jane. With that being said, you can accept the payment on that terminal and then
manually record the payment
in Jane afterwards.
How can I adjust the brightness settings on the terminal?
To start, open up the
Settings
menu on the terminal and click on
Appearance
. From there, you can turn the brightness up or down by using the slider with the option of adjusting the brightness when the terminal is just using the battery or when it’s plugged in.

General Questions
How long is the contract term with Jane Payments?
Just like Jane, there are no contracts or fixed terms with Jane Payments.
What payment methods can Jane Payments accept?
Visa, Visa Debit, MasterCard, Debit Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, UnionPay, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and, if you have a Jane Payments Terminal, Interac Debit.
Can I accept CareCredit through Jane Payments?
Jane Payments does not support the original CareCredit financing card, which requires clinics to be enrolled directly with CareCredit and to process payments through their system.
However, if a client uses the
CareCredit Rewards Mastercard
; a standard credit card issued by Synchrony, it can be accepted through Jane Payments just like any other Mastercard.
In short, traditional CareCredit cards are not supported, but the Rewards Mastercard is.
How do I refund a transaction made through Jane Payments?
You can refund any transaction made through Jane Payments right in Jane, without your client being present. The only exception is if the payment was made on an Interac Debit card, which will need to be inserted into the Jane Payments Terminal first in order to process a refund. Please note, the original transaction fees will not be refunded.
Will Jane store my clients’ payment data?
No credit card data is stored in Jane. When you enter credit card information into Jane, Jane creates and keeps a token that can be used to reference that information. But the actual sensitive information is sent to and stored within our payment partner Stripe, which holds the highest security certification in the industry. 🔒
What’s that odd, small charge on my client’s credit card?
Your client may see a $1 or less “pending” charge on their credit card or bank statement when their card is added to their file. This is a temporary authorization charge which is used to ensure the card provided is valid and able to accept charges. These authorizations will drop off the patient’s card statement after a few days and may appear as long as 7 business days.
Clients are able to speak with their card issuer to confirm this is the case, as well as confirm when it is expected to drop off their statement if they have any concerns.
Why did my client’s card decline?
When you’re taking a payment using Jane Payments, we send a request to your client’s credit card issuer, who lets us know if it’s “Approved” or “Declined.” Whenever a credit card is declined, we often jump to conclusions and assume it’s due to insufficient funds (but that’s not usually the case). Jane tries to give you as much information as possible about why a transaction is declined, but often times, we don’t receive a lot of information about the “why” from your patient’s credit card provider.
If your client has ensured that their credit card is valid and should work, it would be best to have them call their credit card issuing bank or provider to ensure they’re not blocking or preventing the payment, and to make sure their billing address is up to date. We wish we could call them on your behalf, but they only speak to cardholders.

Why did an unexpected error occur when charging my client’s card?
An “Unexpected Error” Occurred or “Something went wrong” When Using a Jane Payments Credit Card
When processing a credit card, if there is a message that pops up stating that
Something went wrong
or an
Unexpected Error
has come up, this is usually due to the patient’s bank needing additional authentication.
It would be best to recommend the patient reach out to their bank to see if they need to provide further verification. Once that has been confirmed, you can charge the credit card to go through successfully.
Note
: One of the most common reasons this happens is that the bank or credit card issuer needs the patient to complete the 3D Secure Authentication
.
How can I assign or unassign a practitioner to a payment account?
Assigning a practitioner to a payment account lets Jane know to process all online payments, such as those through pay balance requests or during online booking, to that practitioner.
By default, this will be set to “All Staff.” If you’re a solo practitioner, we’d recommend leaving this as “All Staff.” For multi practitioner clinics with two or more payment accounts, you’ll want to select the correct practitioner from the drop down menu.
Can a refund be processed if the original card used for payment has expired?
This depends on the bank! Most banks, if the patient or client is still with them, will just re-route the refund to the correct place, whether that’s the patients new credit card with the bank, or another space altogehter.
There is no way of knowing if this will occur, so the clinic can try to process the refund through the expired credit card. If you run into an error this means that the refund cannot go through, and the clinic would need to provide that refunded money to the clinic in other ways, like a cheque, Paypal or e-transfer.
Can I remove all patient credit card information at once?
No
, you would need to remove the credit card information from each patient’s profile individually, ensuring that you have the appropriate
access level
within Jane to do so.
How can I differentiate between a Jane Payments Terminal payment, and an Online Payments transaction?
This is best clarified by checking over your transactions under the clinic’s
Jane Payments Transaction
report, under the
Reports
tab.
⚠️ Accessing the Jane Payments Transaction report (and any report) requires the staff profile to have Administrative/All Staff or higher as their permission level. For a review of this and other permission levels in Jane, check out our guide here:
Staff Access Levels
.
Once in this report, set your date ranges for the transaction in question, and on the right you’ll see the following labels & tags:
Card on File (in blue)
= an Online Payment:
Terminal (in green)
= a Jane Payment Terminal payment:
For Canadian clinics,
Terminal - Interac (in pink)
= a Jane Payments Terminal payment processed through Interac debit:
How can I update the name that appears on a client’s statement when they’re charged?
To update this language, you’ll want to head over to the
Settings
tab, then within the left sidebar menu, select
Jane Payments
. From there, you’ll click on the
blue pencil icon
on the correct Jane Payments account.
From there, you can review or edit the
Statement Descriptor
field. Make sure to hit the blue
Save
button to confirm those changes.
NOTE
📍:
On the actual statement, the statement descriptor will have what is entered in the clinic’s account under Statement Descriptor and North Vancouver. This is because the transaction is processed through Jane and our business is located in North Vancouver. We are not able to change the location to the clinic’s actual location, but including the clinic’s name or an abbreviation may be helpful to clarify where the charge is coming from.
Why is my patient’s statement showing a different name than what is indicated under my Statement Descriptor settings?
If you’ve already confirmed that the
Statement Descriptor
is correctly entered, it’s important to note that banks and card issuers use several data points from a given transaction to determine which friendly name and logo to display. Since each bank does this differently, the behaviour is not consistent across all patients or banking systems.
Jane Payments settings do not have control over or have an impact on these mapping systems. The recommendation here would be for the clinic to reach out to that card issuer to get that incorrect merchant name or image mapping updated on their end.
Can appointments be booked with an expired card on file?
No
- If a patient’s saved credit has expired, and your clinic has their Online Booking Payment Policy set to require a credit card on file, a deposit, or full payment the patient will be asked to enter in a new credit card.
Can an existing Stripe account be linked to Jane?
No, a
Stripe Standard
account cannot be integrated with Jane.
If you already have a
Stripe Express
account through another platform, signing up for Jane Payments will create a second, separate Express account. Using the same email and phone number for both accounts will let you easily toggle between them in your Stripe dashboard.
What’s the difference between Stripe Express and Full accounts?
If you’re using Jane Payments in Canada or the U.S., you’ll be set up with a
Stripe Express account
which is integrated with your Jane account to give you all the features and real-time reporting that Jane has to offer. Jane manages the payout schedule and other configurations, so you can focus on what you do best—running your practice.
All other countries (where Stripe offers services) are set up with a
Stripe Standard Account
. Jane users can process payments within Jane but do not have all the same features and benefits that our North American folks get with an Express Account.
Are there fees for processing a refund through Jane Payments?
If you ever need to issue a refund through Jane Payments, there’s no extra fee to do so. However, the processing fee from the original transaction isn’t returned.
Here’s a quick look at the processing rates, depending on where your clinic is located:
🇨🇦
Canada
:
Online: 2.75% per transaction
Terminal: 2.50% per transaction, $0.10 for Interac Debit
🇺🇸
USA
:
Online: 2.85% + $0.25 per transaction
Terminal: 2.6% + $0.10 per transaction
The fees do not include any federal or provincial sales tax.
What is the hole with the headphone symbol one the side of the terminal for?
The headphone jack on the side of the terminal has no specific use and is non-functional currently.
Why am I receiving a “Your Card Does Not Support This Type of Purchase” error message?
This error is less common than a standard “Decline” and usually indicates that the transaction is being restricted by the cardholder’s bank or credit card issuer.
Often times, this is related to
Health Spending Account (HSA) cards
.
This can happen if the
Merchant Category Code (MCC)
associated with your Jane Payments account doesn’t match what the HSA card requires for eligible purchases. The MCC is a code that identifies your business type to the card issuer, and if it doesn’t align with the HSA card’s criteria, the transaction will fail with this error.
However, this error can also appear with non-HSA cards, depending on restrictions set by the cardholder’s bank. The recommendation here would be for the patient to reach out to their cardholder to see the limitations of their card set up.
How can I change my clinic’s MCC?
When you sign up for a Jane Payments account, we automatically set you up with
MCC 8099
. This is for Medical Services and Health Practitioners. If you’re not sure whether MCC 8099 is right for your business, it’s a good idea to review the primary services you offer and consult with the Jane Payments team, or your payment processor (if you’re not using Jane Payments), to confirm the most appropriate code, and have that updated for you.
Can I process international cards through Jane Payments?
Yes
, your patients can pay using credit cards from different countries (i.e. a patient has a Mexican credit card, but your clinic is based in Canada). The payment will be processed in the clinic’s local currency, and the funds will be deposited into the clinic’s bank account in the same currency. The processing fees are consistent, and you can find the current rates at
Jane Payments Rates
.
Afterward, the patient’s credit card company will convert the amount into their local currency (USD, MXN, GBP, etc.) for their credit card statement. Please note that some cardholders may incur a currency conversion fee, depending on their bank’s policies and the type of card they have.
Can I copy credit cards from one profile to another?
While there isn’t a way to copy credit card details from one profile to another, you can set up a
Relationship
between the two client or patient profiles.
Once the relationship is set up and you’ve selected the correct permissions, you can use a patient’s credit card to pay for another related patients outstanding balance. Check out our
Payments for Related Clients
for more details.
Payouts & Deposits
When do I get my Jane Payments deposits?
With Jane Payments, you’ll receive a deposit every business day on a two day rolling basis (so Monday’s transactions deposit on Wednesday morning, and Friday’s transactions deposit on Tuesday morning). Keep in mind if there is a federal holiday, it will be delayed by a business day (since a holiday isn’t one).
The cutoff time for Jane Payments is 11:59 pm ET / 8:59 pm PT. This means that all payments processed before 11:59 pm for our East Coasters and 8:59 pm for those of us out West will be deposited into your account at the same time. Say goodbye to having payments from the same calendar day split into two deposits on two separate days! We hope this helps make your bookkeeping a little easier.
There are a couple of reports in Jane that will help you track these payments and deposits, as well.
Head to the Reports tab and choose Jane Payments Transactions from the lefthand side. Here you can see all payments taken on the dates you’ve selected, as well as the patient name, how the transaction was taken, as well as your payment processing fees.
You can also click Jane Payments Payouts from the lefthand side, where you’ll see a list of all the payouts for the selected period of time, as well as any that are en route to your bank account.
What should I do if I have multiple practitioners that need to be paid out directly?
With Jane’s Online Payments, you can set up as many accounts as you need to pay out directly. When using a Jane Payments Terminal for in-person payments, all of your practitioners can use one terminal and be paid out individually. We know, it’s pretty magical! 💫 If you’d like to learn more,
this guide is for you
.
Are there any reports to help me keep track of staff transactions and payouts?
There sure are. Under the
Reports
tab, you’ll see the
Jane Payments Transactions
and
Jane Payments Payouts
reports, which give you real-time information about your transactions, processing fees, and deposits.
The Jane Payments Transactions report can be viewed by staff members with
Front Desk, Administrator / All Billing, or Full Access
and the Jane Payments Payouts report can be viewed by staff members with
Full Access
.
As with many other reports in Jane, you can print or export this information to a spreadsheet file by clicking on the
three horizontal black dots
, in case you’d like to pass it along to your bookkeeper, accountant or a practitioner with limited access.
If you have questions about reconciling your payouts with your bank statements, feel free to check out our guide
Investigating Your Jane Payments Payouts
, which goes over this topic in detail.

There are no monthly or annual fees with Jane Payments. You’ll only ever pay for what you process!

Does the Jane Payments Terminal save credit cards on file for future use?

Saving credit cards from the Jane Payments Terminal
.
Can my clients leave a tip?
You bet! Check out our guide to
Tips on the Jane Payments Terminal
to learn more.
Why is a tip shown as a credit on a patient’s account after payment is accepted through the terminal?
When a tip is received on the Jane Payments Terminal and applied to an invoice that is not assigned to a specific staff member, Jane does not know who should receive the tip. As a result, the tip appears as a credit on the patient’s account.
To resolve this issue,  you’ll want to walk through your regular workflow for receiving a payment or head to the patient’s profile. From there, you can click on the
Billing
tab within the profile, select
Payments
, and click on the blue
Receive Payment
button.
On the next page, click on the blue
Add a Tip
text to add the tip manually. You’ll want to ensure that you select the correct staff member’s name from the dropdown menu to whom the tip is intended and enter the total credit amount.
Click on the blue
Next
button at the bottom of the page and ensure the credit is selected as the payment method to complete. If the credit isn’t auto-populated, then you can click on the blue
Add Payment Method
text and select it within the window that opens.
Do I need internet/wifi to use the Jane Payments Terminal?
Yes, the Jane Payments terminal will require a strong, reliable internet or wifi connection to function. If you are a mobile clinic 🚙, we recommend reaching out with any questions before purchasing.
Can I use the Jane Payments Terminal to pay out to multiple bank accounts?
With the
Jane Payments Terminal
, you can link to each of your practitioner’s bank accounts to send them their payments directly. 💸 Yep, you heard that right, no need for multiple terminals.
Does a Jane Payments Terminal have a warranty?
Yes! When you purchase a Jane Payments Terminal, it comes with a one-year warranty.
Where can I find my receipt for the Jane Payments terminal purchase?
If you’re looking for a receipt for your terminal purchase, the listed
Account Owner
can send an email to
payments@jane.app
. Our Payments team will issue a receipt via the email listed in the Account Owner’s profile.
Can I return my Jane Payments Terminal?
Your Jane Payments (POS or point of sale) Terminal can be returned for a refund within the first
30 days
after placing your order. Unfortunately, we’re not able to accept returns after that date. Please reach out to the Jane Payments team at
payments@jane.app
with the reason for the return to start the process.
Is there a way to connect an external card reader (or POS) to Jane?
No
, currently we only support the Jane Payments terminal and there isn’t a way to connect or integrate an external terminal to Jane. With that being said, you can accept the payment on that terminal and then
manually record the payment
in Jane afterwards.
How can I adjust the brightness settings on the terminal?
To start, open up the
Settings
menu on the terminal and click on
Appearance
. From there, you can turn the brightness up or down by using the slider with the option of adjusting the brightness when the terminal is just using the battery or when it’s plugged in.
