If you’re not signed up yet, you can learn more about\nJane Payments\nand\nget all set up\nwhen you’re ready!\nThis guide covers gift cards that clients can purchase\nonline\n. If you’re curious about gift cards that clients can purchase administratively while at your clinic, our\nGift Card Overview\nguide is a great place to start.\nDid you know that the gift cards you know and love can now be purchased by clients online? Whether they want to treat themselves or a loved one, they can purchase a gift card and receive a code to share with the lucky gift recipient. 📩\nThis feature is a great way for smaller clinics that don’t have a third-party gift card system to attract new clients through gift-giving, and have a little extra income, too!\nIf you’d like a refresher on how our gift cards work, you can\nread the overview here\n.\nLet’s get started!\nSetting up Online Gift Cards\nAdding a link to your website\nClient experience: Purchasing a gift card\nFAQ\nSetting up Online Gift Cards\nSetting up Online Gift Cards couldn’t be simpler. We’ll head to\nSettings\non the top bar of Jane and select\nBilling Settings\non the left menu:\nIn the\nGift Cards\nsection, we have four settings to look at.\nThe first checkbox simply enables Gift Cards for your Jane account (to be sold administratively).\nThe second setting allows clients to purchase gift cards online.\nIf your clinic doesn’t offer online booking, your clients will still be able to purchase gift cards with this setting enabled.\nThe third setting is the maximum amount that you or your staff can be loaded onto a gift card.\nThe fourth setting is the maximum amount a patient or other customer can purchase when buying a gift card online. Please note, there is a mandatory $10 minimum for gift cards.\nOnce you’re happy with the settings you’ve chosen, you can click\nSave Billing Information\nat the bottom of the screen.\nWe’re finished setting up! 🎉\nAdding a link to your website\nIf you want to get fancy, you can embed the link to purchase gift cards on your own website. You can head to\nSettings\non the top bar of Jane, then\nBilling Settings\non the left:\nNext, you can scroll down to the\nGift Cards section\nand copy the link there to use on your external website or on social media:\nHere’s what it looks like when someone follows that link and they aren’t signed in:\nAnd here’s what it looks like when someone follows the link and they are signed in:\nFantastic! Let’s take a look at the client’s experience of purchasing a gift card online.\nClient experience: Purchasing a gift card\nThere are three different ways that a client can find your Gift Card purchase page:\nBy clicking on your gift card link that you post on social media or embed in your external website. (Check out the previous section for details.)\nBy clicking the\nBuy a gift card\nlink on your Thanks for Booking page.\nBy following the link on the sidebar of your Online Booking page.\nLet’s walk through what it looks like to purchase a gift card from the sidebar of your Online Booking page.\nWhen a client visits your online booking site, they’ll see a\nBuy Gift Card\nbutton to the left of the page.\nPlease note, if you have more than one location listed on your online booking site, the client will need to choose a location before they see the button.\nThis is just part of our site design, but clients will still be able to redeem their gift card at any of your clinic locations.\nOnce your client clicks the\nBuy Gift Card\nbutton, they’ll see the message below and they can click\nSign In To Buy Gift Card.\nNext, they’ll come to the page below where they can view the price list of your shared services available for online booking. If your services don’t include tax in the price listed online, then clients will see the service subtotal. This gives them an idea of how much to load the card with in order to gift someone a specific service.\nThey can sign in (if they aren’t already) or create an account before completing their purchase.\nThe client can use any of their stored cards or add a new one and then click the Buy Gift Card button.\nOn the next screen, they’ll see the Gift Card code which they can give to the recipient. They can click the Send button and their default email program will open with a pre-populated message that they can edit.\nLooking to create the gift card on behalf of a patient? You can head over to their\nProfile\n>\nBilling\n>\nGift Cards\n>\nNew Gift Card\n.\nCheck out our guide doc on\nCreate and Load a Gift Card Administratively\nthat walks through the steps in a bit more detail.\nFAQ\nCan anyone purchase a gift card without an account?\nHow does the gift card recipient get their code?\nHow can clients redeem online gift cards?\nCan clients redeem gift cards online?\nWhere can clients see which gift cards they’ve purchased?\nCan staff see a client’s gift card code from the admin side of Jane?\nWhat payment methods are accepted to purchase gift cards?\nMy clinic has multiple Jane Payments accounts. Which one does the gift card sale get paid out to?\nI’m a solo practitioner so I don’t have the same menu on my online booking site. How can I direct clients to the link to buy a gift card?\nCan a gift card be reloaded online?\nWhy would I want the option to set two different caps for the Gift Card load limit and Gift card online sale limit?\nIs there a way to add an expiry date to a gift card?\nCan anyone purchase a gift card without an account?\nVery good question. As a security measure, customers must create an account (if they don’t already have one) prior to purchasing a gift card. This also means that if they lose track of the code for their gift card, they can log into their account to find it.\nHow does the gift card recipient get their code?\nThe person who purchased the gift card will see a Send button on the final screen after completing their purchase. This button opens up their email with a pre-populated message they can edit if they like before sending the Gift Card redemption code.\nHow can clients redeem online gift cards?\nClients can redeem online gift cards the same way as gift cards purchased administratively. Check out this guide on\nRedeeming a Gift Card\nfor step-by-step instructions. 🙂\nCan clients redeem gift cards online?\nGift cards cannot be redeemed online when patients book appointments, and at this time there is no option to purchase products through the patient’s facing side. However, if the patient would like to redeem their gift card, they can provide the gift card code to the clinic, or the clinic can look up the patient’s profile and the gift cards under their billing.\nWhere can clients see which gift cards they’ve purchased?\nClients can see gift cards they’ve purchased on their\nMy Account\npage by selecting\nGift Cards\non the menu to the left. They can also find the gift card redemption codes here too.\nJane tip: Gift cards purchased\nadministratively\nwill not show up in a client’s\nMy Account\narea.\nCan staff see a client’s gift card code from the admin side of Jane?\nYes, staff can view the gift cards and redemption codes that a client has purchased from their\nBilling tab\nunder\nGift Cards\n:\nWhat payment methods are accepted to purchase gift cards?\nBecause gift cards purchased online must be done through the Jane Payments integration, clients can pay by credit card. For online transactions, Jane Payments accepts Amex, Visa, Visa Debit, Mastercard, Debit Mastercard, Discover, Diner Club, and UnionPay.\nMy clinic has multiple Jane Payments accounts. Which one does the gift card sale get paid out to?\nExcellent question! When a gift card is purchased, that money is deposited into the\nlast used\nJane Payments account. At the moment, Jane does not currently have the ability to choose which Jane Payments account the funds are deposited into.\nIf your clinic has multiple Jane Payments Accounts and you’d like to use our Online Gift Card feature, an option here would be to track those gift card sales so that you can manually compensate a practitioner if needed.\nTo view gift card sales, a user with\nAdministrative / All Billing\naccess can head over to the\nReports\ntab within the top blue banner, scroll down to\nBilling\n, and select\nGift Cards:\nThis report will show us gift cards that have been purchased administratively and online. If we’re only concerned with tracking online gift card sales, we want to look for any gift cards with the following format:\nJOHN_SMITH_123_12345\n. All gift cards purchased online will have that same format.\nIn the example below, the card on top was bought online, and the card on the bottom was bought administratively:\nFor this option, you would want to keep a close watch on the\nGift Cards\nreport, see which account the funds were deposited to and then collaborate with staff if funds need to be moved around.\nI’m a solo practitioner so I don’t have the same menu on my online booking site. How can I direct clients to the link to buy a gift card?\nGreat question! You’re right that solo practitioners don’t have the menu on the left of their online booking site,  so you have a couple of options.\nYour existing clients will see the link to purchase a gift card after making an appointment on the Thanks For Booking page:\nYou can also follow\nthe steps here\nto direct clients to your gift card page.\nFirst, you can head to Settings > Billing Settings:\nThen you can copy the link to your Gift Card page:\nYou can paste that link into your\nNotice/Message on Online booking Pages\narea.\nCan a gift card be reloaded online?\nNot at this time, though gift cards can be reloaded administratively for a client.\nWhy would I want the option to set two different caps for the Gift Card load limit and Gift card online sale limit?\nJane has lots of safeguards in place, but whenever gift cards are available there is some risk of bad actors trying to exploit them. By allowing you to set different limits for Gift Card purchases made online and administratively, you have more control over that risk.\nEx. You could choose to allow Gift Cards to be sold/topped up in-person or over the phone for up to $2000, but reduce your Online Gift Card purchase limit to $200.\nIs there a way to add an expiry date to a gift card?\nNo\n- currently there isn’t a way to add an expiry date to a gift card in Jane. However, you are able to add a note by heading over to the\nGift Cards/Certificates\narea of the\nBilling\ntab and then click on\nView\nto the right.\nAdditional Resources\nGift Cards - Overview\nCreate and Load a gift card\nRedeeming a Gift Card\nLooking for a customizable template that you can use and share with your clients? We recommend using a free online design program like\nCanva\n. You can create a free account and start designing your gift certificates right away!\nIdeas and Feedback\nWe want to continue to build this feature with your help!

If you’re not signed up yet, you can learn more about\nJane Payments\nand\nget all set up\nwhen you’re ready!\nThis guide covers gift cards that clients can purchase\nonline\n. If you’re curious about gift cards that clients can purchase administratively while at your clinic, our\nGift Card Overview\nguide is a great place to start.\nDid you know that the gift cards you know and love can now be purchased by clients online? Whether they want to treat themselves or a loved one, they can purchase a gift card and receive a code to share with the lucky gift recipient. 📩\nThis feature is a great way for smaller clinics that don’t have a third-party gift card system to attract new clients through gift-giving, and have a little extra income, too!\nIf you’d like a refresher on how our gift cards work, you can\nread the overview here\n.\nLet’s get started!\nSetting up Online Gift Cards\nAdding a link to your website\nClient experience: Purchasing a gift card\nFAQ\nSetting up Online Gift Cards\nSetting up Online Gift Cards couldn’t be simpler. We’ll head to\nSettings\non the top bar of Jane and select\nBilling Settings\non the left menu:\nIn the\nGift Cards\nsection, we have four settings to look at.\nThe first checkbox simply enables Gift Cards for your Jane account (to be sold administratively).\nThe second setting allows clients to purchase gift cards online.\nIf your clinic doesn’t offer online booking, your clients will still be able to purchase gift cards with this setting enabled.\nThe third setting is the maximum amount that you or your staff can be loaded onto a gift card.\nThe fourth setting is the maximum amount a patient or other customer can purchase when buying a gift card online. Please note, there is a mandatory $10 minimum for gift cards.\nOnce you’re happy with the settings you’ve chosen, you can click\nSave Billing Information\nat the bottom of the screen.\nWe’re finished setting up! 🎉\nAdding a link to your website\nIf you want to get fancy, you can embed the link to purchase gift cards on your own website. You can head to\nSettings\non the top bar of Jane, then\nBilling Settings\non the left:\nNext, you can scroll down to the\nGift Cards section\nand copy the link there to use on your external website or on social media:\nHere’s what it looks like when someone follows that link and they aren’t signed in:\nAnd here’s what it looks like when someone follows the link and they are signed in:\nFantastic! Let’s take a look at the client’s experience of purchasing a gift card online.\nClient experience: Purchasing a gift card\nThere are three different ways that a client can find your Gift Card purchase page:\nBy clicking on your gift card link that you post on social media or embed in your external website. (Check out the previous section for details.)\nBy clicking the\nBuy a gift card\nlink on your Thanks for Booking page.\nBy following the link on the sidebar of your Online Booking page.\nLet’s walk through what it looks like to purchase a gift card from the sidebar of your Online Booking page.\nWhen a client visits your online booking site, they’ll see a\nBuy Gift Card\nbutton to the left of the page.\nPlease note, if you have more than one location listed on your online booking site, the client will need to choose a location before they see the button.\nThis is just part of our site design, but clients will still be able to redeem their gift card at any of your clinic locations.\nOnce your client clicks the\nBuy Gift Card\nbutton, they’ll see the message below and they can click\nSign In To Buy Gift Card.\nNext, they’ll come to the page below where they can view the price list of your shared services available for online booking. If your services don’t include tax in the price listed online, then clients will see the service subtotal. This gives them an idea of how much to load the card with in order to gift someone a specific service.\nThey can sign in (if they aren’t already) or create an account before completing their purchase.\nThe client can use any of their stored cards or add a new one and then click the Buy Gift Card button.\nOn the next screen, they’ll see the Gift Card code which they can give to the recipient. They can click the Send button and their default email program will open with a pre-populated message that they can edit.\nLooking to create the gift card on behalf of a patient? You can head over to their\nProfile\n>\nBilling\n>\nGift Cards\n>\nNew Gift Card\n.\nCheck out our guide doc on\nCreate and Load a Gift Card Administratively\nthat walks through the steps in a bit more detail.\nFAQ\nCan anyone purchase a gift card without an account?\nHow does the gift card recipient get their code?\nHow can clients redeem online gift cards?\nCan clients redeem gift cards online?\nWhere can clients see which gift cards they’ve purchased?\nCan staff see a client’s gift card code from the admin side of Jane?\nWhat payment methods are accepted to purchase gift cards?\nMy clinic has multiple Jane Payments accounts. Which one does the gift card sale get paid out to?\nI’m a solo practitioner so I don’t have the same menu on my online booking site. How can I direct clients to the link to buy a gift card?\nCan a gift card be reloaded online?\nWhy would I want the option to set two different caps for the Gift Card load limit and Gift card online sale limit?\nIs there a way to add an expiry date to a gift card?\nCan anyone purchase a gift card without an account?\nVery good question. As a security measure, customers must create an account (if they don’t already have one) prior to purchasing a gift card. This also means that if they lose track of the code for their gift card, they can log into their account to find it.\nHow does the gift card recipient get their code?\nThe person who purchased the gift card will see a Send button on the final screen after completing their purchase. This button opens up their email with a pre-populated message they can edit if they like before sending the Gift Card redemption code.\nHow can clients redeem online gift cards?\nClients can redeem online gift cards the same way as gift cards purchased administratively. Check out this guide on\nRedeeming a Gift Card\nfor step-by-step instructions. 🙂\nCan clients redeem gift cards online?\nGift cards cannot be redeemed online when patients book appointments, and at this time there is no option to purchase products through the patient’s facing side. However, if the patient would like to redeem their gift card, they can provide the gift card code to the clinic, or the clinic can look up the patient’s profile and the gift cards under their billing.\nWhere can clients see which gift cards they’ve purchased?\nClients can see gift cards they’ve purchased on their\nMy Account\npage by selecting\nGift Cards\non the menu to the left. They can also find the gift card redemption codes here too.\nJane tip: Gift cards purchased\nadministratively\nwill not show up in a client’s\nMy Account\narea.\nCan staff see a client’s gift card code from the admin side of Jane?\nYes, staff can view the gift cards and redemption codes that a client has purchased from their\nBilling tab\nunder\nGift Cards\n:\nWhat payment methods are accepted to purchase gift cards?\nBecause gift cards purchased online must be done through the Jane Payments integration, clients can pay by credit card. For online transactions, Jane Payments accepts Amex, Visa, Visa Debit, Mastercard, Debit Mastercard, Discover, Diner Club, and UnionPay.\nMy clinic has multiple Jane Payments accounts. Which one does the gift card sale get paid out to?\nExcellent question! When a gift card is purchased, that money is deposited into the\nlast used\nJane Payments account. At the moment, Jane does not currently have the ability to choose which Jane Payments account the funds are deposited into.\nIf your clinic has multiple Jane Payments Accounts and you’d like to use our Online Gift Card feature, an option here would be to track those gift card sales so that you can manually compensate a practitioner if needed.\nTo view gift card sales, a user with\nAdministrative / All Billing\naccess can head over to the\nReports\ntab within the top blue banner, scroll down to\nBilling\n, and select\nGift Cards:\nThis report will show us gift cards that have been purchased administratively and online. If we’re only concerned with tracking online gift card sales, we want to look for any gift cards with the following format:\nJOHN_SMITH_123_12345\n. All gift cards purchased online will have that same format.\nIn the example below, the card on top was bought online, and the card on the bottom was bought administratively:\nFor this option, you would want to keep a close watch on the\nGift Cards\nreport, see which account the funds were deposited to and then collaborate with staff if funds need to be moved around.\nI’m a solo practitioner so I don’t have the same menu on my online booking site. How can I direct clients to the link to buy a gift card?\nGreat question! You’re right that solo practitioners don’t have the menu on the left of their online booking site,  so you have a couple of options.\nYour existing clients will see the link to purchase a gift card after making an appointment on the Thanks For Booking page:\nYou can also follow\nthe steps here\nto direct clients to your gift card page.\nFirst, you can head to Settings > Billing Settings:\nThen you can copy the link to your Gift Card page:\nYou can paste that link into your\nNotice/Message on Online booking Pages\narea.\nCan a gift card be reloaded online?\nNot at this time, though gift cards can be reloaded administratively for a client.\nWhy would I want the option to set two different caps for the Gift Card load limit and Gift card online sale limit?\nJane has lots of safeguards in place, but whenever gift cards are available there is some risk of bad actors trying to exploit them. By allowing you to set different limits for Gift Card purchases made online and administratively, you have more control over that risk.\nEx. You could choose to allow Gift Cards to be sold/topped up in-person or over the phone for up to $2000, but reduce your Online Gift Card purchase limit to $200.\nIs there a way to add an expiry date to a gift card?\nNo\n- currently there isn’t a way to add an expiry date to a gift card in Jane. However, you are able to add a note by heading over to the\nGift Cards/Certificates\narea of the\nBilling\ntab and then click on\nView\nto the right.\nAdditional Resources\nGift Cards - Overview\nCreate and Load a gift card\nRedeeming a Gift Card\nLooking for a customizable template that you can use and share with your clients?
