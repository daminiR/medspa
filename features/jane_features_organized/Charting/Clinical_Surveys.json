You can also set up a survey to send daily, weekly, or monthly to individual clients. The answers to the survey questions are added to the chart, much like Jane’s\nIntake Forms\n.\nOutcome Measure Surveys\nYou can use Clinical Surveys to collect client-reported outcome measures before or after appointments, and the results can be scored. To learn more about how to make your survey scorable, check out our guide\nOutcome Measure Surveys\n.\nLet’s get started\nHere’s how you can get started using Clinical Surveys:\nSetting up your Clinical Survey\nSaving your Clinical Survey\nHow to stop sending an All-Patients Survey\nEnabling your Survey on your staff profile\nSending an individual Survey\nManaging an individual Survey from the client profile\nEditing a Clinical Survey\nClient view\nUsing the Template Library\nFAQ\nSetting up your Clinical Survey\nA full-access user can begin by heading over to\nSettings\n>\nForms & Surveys\n>\nView Surveys\non the Clinical Surveys tab.\nIf you would like to start a new survey from scratch, click on\nNew Survey\nin the top right of the screen.\nOn the New Survey page, we’ll start with the General Details section.\nSurvey name\n: This is strictly for internal use, and won’t be visible to clients.\nThere are two options for Setup:\nSet up individually\n: The survey will be available to be sent to individual clients from their profiles.\nSet up for all clients\n: The survey will automatically be sent to all clients for each appointment. You can also set it up to send individually on a client’s profile.\nNext, we’ll choose when we’d like the survey to be sent out.\nIndividual survey options:\nBefore or after an appointment\nOn regular intervals: for example, every week.\nDon’t schedule survey: meaning the survey will not send automatically.\nAll client survey options:\nBefore or after an appointment\n: All clients will be emailed their survey before or after each appointment.\nWhen an appointment is booked online\n: All clients will be prompted to complete the survey each time they book online. Please note, the survey will need to be submitted before clients can complete their booking.\nNext, we’ll move on to the\nCommunication section:\nTitle/Email Subject:\nThis is the title of the survey. It appears at the top of the survey for the client and it will also be the email subject line when the survey is sent out.\nIntroduction Message:\nThis is a block of text that will appear in the survey and in the email. You can use this to help your client understand the purpose of the survey.\nMessage After Completion:\nThis message will appear after the client has finished their survey.\nLast step! Let’s build out the survey questions.\nFor the\nQuestionnaire\nsection, you have a couple of options for building out the questions you’d like your patients to answer.\nTemplate Library:\nThis gives you access to templates another Jane User has shared. You can browse through the options and edit the form once you’ve added it to your survey template.\nAdd Item:\nTo build out your questionnaire from scratch, you can use the 7 chart items.\nChart Templates:\nYou can select a chart template that you’ve created and transfer it to a survey. It’s important to note that certain parts aren’t carried over. You can either click on\nAdd Item\nand you’ll see a\nChart Templates\nsection within the dropdown menu or on the\nwhite square with the gridlines\n.\n💡\nJane tip:\nThe chart items Check Boxes, Range/Scales, and Drop-Downs can be made scorable. To learn more about this feature, check out our guide\nOutcome Measures Surveys\n.\n📍\nNote:\nJust like Intake Forms, some chart items like the Spine Chart, diagram, Body Chart picture, Uploads, Files, Vitals, Chief Complaint, Sketch, or any images cannot be added to surveys. These items are not compatible with our surveys currently.\nSaving your Clinical Survey\nOnce you are happy with how your survey looks, head down to the bottom right of the screen and click\nSave\n. \nIf you chose to create a survey to send automatically to all clients, you’ll get a confirmation message and the option to save and start sending the survey, or save but don’t start sending the survey.\nIf you choose\nSave, But Don’t Send\n, the survey will be saved as an\nindividual survey\nand will not be sent to all clients. When you’re ready to send it to all clients, click\nView\nnext to the survey:\nNext, click\nEdit\nin the\nGeneral Details\nsection:\nSelect\nSet up for all clients\nand then click\nSave\n:\nYou’ll now have the option to\nSave and send\n.\nHow to stop sending an All-Patients Survey\nIf you have a survey that’s sending to all clients or patients automatically, you can stop sending it by heading to\nSettings > Forms & Surveys > Clinical Surveys\n. Click\nView\nto the right of the survey you want to stop sending:\nNext, you’ll click\nEdit\nto the right of the\nGeneral Details\nsection:\nYou’ll want to change the\nSetup\nfield to\nSet up individually\nand then click\nSave\nThe survey will stop sending automatically to all clients for all appointments. However, it will continue to send to individual clients if you’ve set it up on their profile.\nIf you have no individual clients using the survey and you’d like to remove it from your surveys list, you can view the survey and then\nArchive\nit under the Actions menu:\nJust like the Intake Forms, you can only\nArchive\nthe surveys and cannot delete them from your account. If you’d ever want to unarchive a Survey to reuse it, you can do so from the\nSettings\ntab, under\nForms & Surveys\n>\nView Surveys\nand click on the\nArchived\nbutton:\nEnable your Clinical Survey on your staff profile\nNow that the survey has been created, you (and any staff members who will be using the survey) will want to toggle it on from your staff profile so that it’ll show up on the list of surveys you can send and fill out on behalf of your clients:\nStart by navigating to the\nStaff tab\n> click on\nyour name\n>\nTemplates\n>\nSurveys\n>\ntoggle on\nthe survey.\nAll enabled surveys will appear in the chart template list and in the pop-up when you are charting.\nSending an individual survey\nWhether you set up your survey to send automatically to all clients or not, you can send any survey to an individual client from their profile.\nYou’ll want to head to the client’s profile and on the lower right, you’ll see the\nSurveys\narea. Click the\nSet Up\nbutton:\nNext, you’ll see a dropdown menu with all of the surveys that are enabled for your staff profile. Choose the one you’d like to send.\nNext, you can choose when the survey should send. \n-\nBefore or after an appointment\n: This option lets you choose how far in advance or how long after an appointment the survey should be sent. You can also specify how many times the survey should be sent out in total.\nOn regular intervals\n: This option is great if you don’t want the survey to be attached to an appointment. You can choose for it to go out on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule regardless of whether appointments are booked. You can choose what date the survey should stop being sent out.\nDon’t send automatically\n: This option means that the survey will only ever be sent out manually. You can use this option if you want to send a one-off survey.\nManaging an individual survey from the client profile\nOnce you have set up a survey on an individual client’s profile, you can click the three dots to the right of the survey to:\nAdjust sending method\n: here’s where you can change the send settings of the survey.\nEnd survey\n: Delete pending or unsigned surveys. Jane will stop sending out this survey to this client.\nYou can also click the\nFill out\nbutton to fill out the survey on behalf of the client or pass your device to the client to fill it out themselves. Choosing “pass device to client” will log them out of Jane once the survey is completed and you will be prompted to log back in.\nClicking the\nEmail\nbutton will email the survey to the client.\nEditing a Clinical Survey\n⚠️\nIt’s important to note that the\nquestionnaire section\nof a Clinical Survey cannot be edited once it has been completed by at least one client. However, you can edit the other sections of a survey by heading to\nSettings > Forms & Surveys > Clinical Surveys\n. Click\nView\nnext to the Survey you’d like to edit.\nTo edit a template, you’ll first need to\nduplicate\nit:\nNext, you’ll edit your new survey and save it.\nOnce your new survey is saved, you can archive the old one to remove it from your survey list. Click\nView\nto the right of the survey:\nNext, click\nActions\nand select\nArchive\n.\nClient View\nClients will receive a link to the Clinical Survey on the day and time you specified. From here, they can click the\nBegin\nbutton.\nThey will be taken to a dedicated page in their account where they can fill out the form. This form is only accessible from the email and is not currently accessible from within their account.\nOnce the patient fills out the survey, it will be made available to them inside their My Account portal, under the Documents section.\nUsing the Template Library\nClinical surveys use the same template library as intake forms. This means that any of the templates that you create can be reused or modified. Templates can also be used so a staff member can fill out the Clinical Survey on behalf of the client. Save your form as a template and then add that template as a chart entry to fill it out. To access the template library, edit the content of one of your Clinical Surveys and click on the template button as shown below.\nFAQ\n⭐️Why don’t I see some surveys under a client’s profile even when these are enabled under the clinic’s Forms & Surveys section?\nJust like chart templates, staff members should toggle these on under their staff profile to use them.\n⭐️ How do I view a completed Clinical Survey that was submitted by a client?\nGreat question! Clinical Surveys operate similarly to Intake Forms. Once a survey is completed, you’ll find it under the “\nCharts\n“ tab on a client’s profile, dated according to the submission date.\n⭐️ Can I add a signature on the survey?\nYes, we’ve recently added the signature chart part widget to the Clinical Surveys.\nTo add the signature item, you would head over to\nSettings\nand select the clinical survey. Go to the questionnaire section of the survey and click\nadd item\nand select signature.\n⭐️ Can I send a survey out manually or on an individual basis?\nYou bet you can! Check out the section in this guide titled:\nSending a survey to individual clients.\n⭐️ Is there a notification for the survey being complete, or incomplete?\nThis isn’t currently a notification for when the survey is complete or incomplete prior to an appointment. This is something we’re looking at so if you’d like to see it, please feel free to add your vote\nhere\n.\n⭐️ Is it possible to make the screening survey available to be completed prior to entry if a patient did not complete the email on an iPad in the clinic?\nThe client can access the survey at any time using their mobile phone or tablet. The client can access their email and fill it out while they are waiting. There currently isn’t a method to access a direct link to the survey from an iPad in the clinic.\n⭐️ How do I know if a client has opened their survey?\nCurrently, Jane only shows whether a survey is pending or completed status.\nThe best way to check whether the client opened the survey or not is to look at the survey email status under the Communications log.\nIf the email has “clicked” status it means the client has clicked on a link in that email.\nIf you’d like to learn more about the email messages status, check out our guide on the\nCommunications Log\nfor more information.\n⭐️ Can we add an “Accuracy of information” consent to the end of a clinical survey?\nYes, you can completely customize the form yourself using the editor to add any informational sections you believe will be helpful at any point in the survey.\n⭐️ Do Clinical Surveys send out for Online Appointments?\nYes, you have the option to send Clinical Surveys for all appointments, in-person appointments only, or online appointments only.\n⭐️ Can I use conditional formatting or markdown within a Survey? (i.e. bold, italicize or underlines)\nNo\n- at the moment this formatting is not support within the Questionnaire portion of a survey. With that being said, it does look like our Jane community has been a bit vocal about wanting the ability add more formatting options to their survey templates.\nYou can add your vote along with any feedback that you’d like to share here:\nMore Formatting Options\nFor more information on our feature requests page, you can check out our\nFeature Requests\nguide.\n⭐️ Can I change the patient on a clinical survey?\nIf a staff member completed the survey for a patient, you can update the information by going to the\nCharts\nsection in the patient’s profile. Click the chart to expand it, then select the\ncogwheel icon\nand choose\nChange Patient\nfrom the dropdown menu.\nIn the pop-up window, type the patient’s name and select it from the list.\nSigned and Locked Surveys\nJane will display a final confirmation letting you know that the entry is\nsigned\n. An amendment is automatically added to indicate that the chart was added incorrectly to the patient’s record and has been moved.\nDraft Surveys\nAfter you type and select the patient’s name, Jane will display a pop-up window informing you that no amendment will be added to this chart.\nWe hope Clinical Surveys can help you open your practice more safely and efficiently.

You can also set up a survey to send daily, weekly, or monthly to individual clients. The answers to the survey questions are added to the chart, much like Jane’s\nIntake Forms\n.\nOutcome Measure Surveys\nYou can use Clinical Surveys to collect client-reported outcome measures before or after appointments, and the results can be scored. To learn more about how to make your survey scorable, check out our guide\nOutcome Measure Surveys\n.\nLet’s get started\nHere’s how you can get started using Clinical Surveys:\nSetting up your Clinical Survey\nSaving your Clinical Survey\nHow to stop sending an All-Patients Survey\nEnabling your Survey on your staff profile\nSending an individual Survey\nManaging an individual Survey from the client profile\nEditing a Clinical Survey\nClient view\nUsing the Template Library\nFAQ\nSetting up your Clinical Survey\nA full-access user can begin by heading over to\nSettings\n>\nForms & Surveys\n>\nView Surveys\non the Clinical Surveys tab.\nIf you would like to start a new survey from scratch, click on\nNew Survey\nin the top right of the screen.\nOn the New Survey page, we’ll start with the General Details section.\nSurvey name\n: This is strictly for internal use, and won’t be visible to clients.\nThere are two options for Setup:\nSet up individually\n: The survey will be available to be sent to individual clients from their profiles.\nSet up for all clients\n: The survey will automatically be sent to all clients for each appointment. You can also set it up to send individually on a client’s profile.\nNext, we’ll choose when we’d like the survey to be sent out.\nIndividual survey options:\nBefore or after an appointment\nOn regular intervals: for example, every week.\nDon’t schedule survey: meaning the survey will not send automatically.\nAll client survey options:\nBefore or after an appointment\n: All clients will be emailed their survey before or after each appointment.\nWhen an appointment is booked online\n: All clients will be prompted to complete the survey each time they book online. Please note, the survey will need to be submitted before clients can complete their booking.\nNext, we’ll move on to the\nCommunication section:\nTitle/Email Subject:\nThis is the title of the survey. It appears at the top of the survey for the client and it will also be the email subject line when the survey is sent out.\nIntroduction Message:\nThis is a block of text that will appear in the survey and in the email. You can use this to help your client understand the purpose of the survey.\nMessage After Completion:\nThis message will appear after the client has finished their survey.\nLast step! Let’s build out the survey questions.\nFor the\nQuestionnaire\nsection, you have a couple of options for building out the questions you’d like your patients to answer.\nTemplate Library:\nThis gives you access to templates another Jane User has shared. You can browse through the options and edit the form once you’ve added it to your survey template.\nAdd Item:\nTo build out your questionnaire from scratch, you can use the 7 chart items.\nChart Templates:\nYou can select a chart template that you’ve created and transfer it to a survey. It’s important to note that certain parts aren’t carried over. You can either click on\nAdd Item\nand you’ll see a\nChart Templates\nsection within the dropdown menu or on the\nwhite square with the gridlines\n.\n💡\nJane tip:\nThe chart items Check Boxes, Range/Scales, and Drop-Downs can be made scorable. To learn more about this feature, check out our guide\nOutcome Measures Surveys\n.\n📍\nNote:\nJust like Intake Forms, some chart items like the Spine Chart, diagram, Body Chart picture, Uploads, Files, Vitals, Chief Complaint, Sketch, or any images cannot be added to surveys. These items are not compatible with our surveys currently.\nSaving your Clinical Survey\nOnce you are happy with how your survey looks, head down to the bottom right of the screen and click\nSave\n. \nIf you chose to create a survey to send automatically to all clients, you’ll get a confirmation message and the option to save and start sending the survey, or save but don’t start sending the survey.\nIf you choose\nSave, But Don’t Send\n, the survey will be saved as an\nindividual survey\nand will not be sent to all clients. When you’re ready to send it to all clients, click\nView\nnext to the survey:\nNext, click\nEdit\nin the\nGeneral Details\nsection:\nSelect\nSet up for all clients\nand then click\nSave\n:\nYou’ll now have the option to\nSave and send\n.\nHow to stop sending an All-Patients Survey\nIf you have a survey that’s sending to all clients or patients automatically, you can stop sending it by heading to\nSettings > Forms & Surveys > Clinical Surveys\n. Click\nView\nto the right of the survey you want to stop sending:\nNext, you’ll click\nEdit\nto the right of the\nGeneral Details\nsection:\nYou’ll want to change the\nSetup\nfield to\nSet up individually\nand then click\nSave\nThe survey will stop sending automatically to all clients for all appointments. However, it will continue to send to individual clients if you’ve set it up on their profile.\nIf you have no individual clients using the survey and you’d like to remove it from your surveys list, you can view the survey and then\nArchive\nit under the Actions menu:\nJust like the Intake Forms, you can only\nArchive\nthe surveys and cannot delete them from your account. If you’d ever want to unarchive a Survey to reuse it, you can do so from the\nSettings\ntab, under\nForms & Surveys\n>\nView Surveys\nand click on the\nArchived\nbutton:\nEnable your Clinical Survey on your staff profile\nNow that the survey has been created, you (and any staff members who will be using the survey) will want to toggle it on from your staff profile so that it’ll show up on the list of surveys you can send and fill out on behalf of your clients:\nStart by navigating to the\nStaff tab\n> click on\nyour name\n>\nTemplates\n>\nSurveys\n>\ntoggle on\nthe survey.\nAll enabled surveys will appear in the chart template list and in the pop-up when you are charting.\nSending an individual survey\nWhether you set up your survey to send automatically to all clients or not, you can send any survey to an individual client from their profile.\nYou’ll want to head to the client’s profile and on the lower right, you’ll see the\nSurveys\narea. Click the\nSet Up\nbutton:\nNext, you’ll see a dropdown menu with all of the surveys that are enabled for your staff profile. Choose the one you’d like to send.\nNext, you can choose when the survey should send. \n-\nBefore or after an appointment\n: This option lets you choose how far in advance or how long after an appointment the survey should be sent. You can also specify how many times the survey should be sent out in total.\nOn regular intervals\n: This option is great if you don’t want the survey to be attached to an appointment. You can choose for it to go out on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule regardless of whether appointments are booked. You can choose what date the survey should stop being sent out.\nDon’t send automatically\n: This option means that the survey will only ever be sent out manually. You can use this option if you want to send a one-off survey.\nManaging an individual survey from the client profile\nOnce you have set up a survey on an individual client’s profile, you can click the three dots to the right of the survey to:\nAdjust sending method\n: here’s where you can change the send settings of the survey.\nEnd survey\n: Delete pending or unsigned surveys. Jane will stop sending out this survey to this client.\nYou can also click the\nFill out\nbutton to fill out the survey on behalf of the client or pass your device to the client to fill it out themselves. Choosing “pass device to client” will log them out of Jane once the survey is completed and you will be prompted to log back in.\nClicking the\nEmail\nbutton will email the survey to the client.\nEditing a Clinical Survey\n⚠️\nIt’s important to note that the\nquestionnaire section\nof a Clinical Survey cannot be edited once it has been completed by at least one client. However, you can edit the other sections of a survey by heading to\nSettings > Forms & Surveys > Clinical Surveys\n. Click\nView\nnext to the Survey you’d like to edit.\nTo edit a template, you’ll first need to\nduplicate\nit:\nNext, you’ll edit your new survey and save it.\nOnce your new survey is saved, you can archive the old one to remove it from your survey list. Click\nView\nto the right of the survey:\nNext, click\nActions\nand select\nArchive\n.\nClient View\nClients will receive a link to the Clinical Survey on the day and time you specified. From here, they can click the\nBegin\nbutton.\nThey will be taken to a dedicated page in their account where they can fill out the form. This form is only accessible from the email and is not currently accessible from within their account.\nOnce the patient fills out the survey, it will be made available to them inside their My Account portal, under the Documents section.\nUsing the Template Library\nClinical surveys use the same template library as intake forms. This means that any of the templates that you create can be reused or modified. Templates can also be used so a staff member can fill out the Clinical Survey on behalf of the client. Save your form as a template and then add that template as a chart entry to fill it out. To access the template library, edit the content of one of your Clinical Surveys and click on the template button as shown below.\nFAQ\n⭐️Why don’t I see some surveys under a client’s profile even when these are enabled under the clinic’s Forms & Surveys section?\nJust like chart templates, staff members should toggle these on under their staff profile to use them.\n⭐️ How do I view a completed Clinical Survey that was submitted by a client?\nGreat question! Clinical Surveys operate similarly to Intake Forms. Once a survey is completed, you’ll find it under the “\nCharts\n“ tab on a client’s profile, dated according to the submission date.\n⭐️ Can I add a signature on the survey?\nYes, we’ve recently added the signature chart part widget to the Clinical Surveys.\nTo add the signature item, you would head over to\nSettings\nand select the clinical survey. Go to the questionnaire section of the survey and click\nadd item\nand select signature.\n⭐️ Can I send a survey out manually or on an individual basis?\nYou bet you can! Check out the section in this guide titled:\nSending a survey to individual clients.\n⭐️ Is there a notification for the survey being complete, or incomplete?\nThis isn’t currently a notification for when the survey is complete or incomplete prior to an appointment. This is something we’re looking at so if you’d like to see it, please feel free to add your vote\nhere\n.\n⭐️ Is it possible to make the screening survey available to be completed prior to entry if a patient did not complete the email on an iPad in the clinic?\nThe client can access the survey at any time using their mobile phone or tablet. The client can access their email and fill it out while they are waiting. There currently isn’t a method to access a direct link to the survey from an iPad in the clinic.\n⭐️ How do I know if a client has opened their survey?\nCurrently, Jane only shows whether a survey is pending or completed status.\nThe best way to check whether the client opened the survey or not is to look at the survey email status under the Communications log.\nIf the email has “clicked” status it means the client has clicked on a link in that email.\nIf you’d like to learn more about the email messages status, check out our guide on the\nCommunications Log\nfor more information.\n⭐️ Can we add an “Accuracy of information” consent to the end of a clinical survey?\nYes, you can completely customize the form yourself using the editor to add any informational sections you believe will be helpful at any point in the survey.\n⭐️ Do Clinical Surveys send out for Online Appointments?\nYes, you have the option to send Clinical Surveys for all appointments, in-person appointments only, or online appointments only.\n⭐️ Can I use conditional formatting or markdown within a Survey? (i.e. bold, italicize or underlines)\nNo\n- at the moment this formatting is not support within the Questionnaire portion of a survey. With that being said, it does look like our Jane community has been a bit vocal about wanting the ability add more formatting options to their survey templates.\nYou can add your vote along with any feedback that you’d like to share here:\nMore Formatting Options\nFor more information on our feature requests page, you can check out our\nFeature Requests\nguide.\n⭐️ Can I change the patient on a clinical survey?\nIf a staff member completed the survey for a patient, you can update the information by going to the\nCharts\nsection in the patient’s profile. Click the chart to expand it, then select the\ncogwheel icon\nand choose\nChange Patient\nfrom the dropdown menu.\nIn the pop-up window, type the patient’s name and select it from the list.\nSigned and Locked Surveys\nJane will display a final confirmation letting you know that the entry is\nsigned\n. An amendment is automatically added to indicate that the chart was added incorrectly to the patient’s record and has been moved.\nDraft Surveys\nAfter you type and select the patient’s name, Jane will display a pop-up window informing you that no amendment will be added to this chart.\nWe hope Clinical Surveys can help you open your practice more safely and efficiently.
