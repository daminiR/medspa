Whether a parent is paying for a minor or paying for multiple invoices at once for a family chiro visit, Jane can accurately reflect the payer of an invoice (and the payment method) when one client is paying for someone else.
For those of you who’ve been running with Jane for a while, you might remember having to use a gift card workaround in order to use one client’s account credit for a related client. Feel free to use up any gift card balances from that old workaround before switching to this new and improved workflow.
To use this feature, you’ll first need to set up a Relationship on your clients’ profiles. I’ll show you how to do that first, and then we’ll go through the two common scenarios below in more detail:
Setting up a Relationship
Scenario 1: A client pays for a related client’s invoice
Scenario 2: A client pays for their own invoice and a related client’s invoice
FAQ
Step 1: Setting up a Relationship
In order to use the Payments for Related Clients feature, you’ll first want to link client profiles with the Relationships feature. Here’s our
guide
on how to set this up. This will allow us to specify who can pay for someone’s visit, along with a few other Relationship options.
Jane tip
💡: For privacy and security purposes, an email notification is sent to clients whenever their information becomes shared via a Relationship — specifically, when a relationship is set up or edited in a way that grants a family member new access to the client’s personal information.
Scenario 1: A client pays for a related client’s invoice
Let’s use Albert and his son, Baby Bert, as examples. Baby Bert is done with his treatment and he’s feeling refreshed. Let’s pay for his visit so he can go home and enjoy a well-deserved nap.
If you’re working from the schedule view, you can select Baby Bert’s appointment, and click the
Pay
button in the upper-right:
This brings us to the Receive Payment screen, where we can select any outstanding invoices for Baby Bert that we’d like to pay for in this transaction. In this case, Baby Bert just has one outstanding invoice to pay, so we’ll click the blue
Next
button:
On the second Receive Payment screen, we choose our payment method, and then we can select a different payer:
Payments and Invoices
This feature has no effect on how invoices are generated. When we arrive an appointment, Jane knows to generate the invoice on the profile of the client who received the service.
The client’s
account
or
appointment
we
click the Pay button from
will be the profile the payment is listed on.
Here’s what that looks like on the Invoice:
Scenario 2: A client pays for their own invoice and a related client’s invoice
📣 Quick tip: If you’re a chiropractic clinic offering family chiro visits, then you’ll want to double-book your appointments and use this workflow to settle up all outstanding invoices with a single payment (if one person’s covering the bill 😉). There’s more on this workflow in the FAQ below.
Albert and Baby Bert are each getting a treatment today, and we’ve arrived both of their visits.
If we’re on the schedule view, we can select Albert’s appointment since he’s the one paying for both visits and click the
Pay
button in the upper-right corner.
Since we’ve clicked the
Pay
button from
Albert’s
appointment panel, the entire payment he makes will live on his profile.
On the Receive Payment screen, we’ll see the message that an additional outstanding balance for a related profile is available. We’ll click Show to see the invoice:
This shows us the details for the outstanding invoice and if we want to pay for it in this transaction, we’ll check off the box to the right:
On the second Receive Payment screen, we’ll already have Albert selected as the payer, so we can just take payment as normal:
Invoices and Payments
This feature has no effect on how invoices are generated. Once we arrive an appointment, the invoice is generated on the profile of the client who received the service. So in this case, both Albert and Baby Bert have separate invoices.
The client’s account or appointment where we click the
Pay
button will be the profile the
payment
is listed on.
FAQ
Whose profile does a payment show up under?
Whose profile does an invoice show up under?
I don’t want my child to receive financial texts or emails, how can I set that up?
Is this workflow good for family chiropractic visits?
Can related profiles now use each other’s account credit?
Can I disable a relationship if needed?
Do clients receive a notification when their relationship permissions are changed administratively?
Can a parent pay for two (or more) children in one transaction (when the parent has not had an appointment)?
Can a client pay for a related profile online from their My Account area?
Whose profile does a payment show up under?
The profile a payment is listed on will depend on whose appointment (or profile) we click the Pay button from.
Whose profile does an invoice show up under?
As always, once we click the
Arrive
button on an appointment, Jane generates an invoice on the client’s profile who received the service.
I don’t want my child to receive financial texts or emails, how can I set that up?
Excellent question. We have a setting that can turn off financial communications for one patient profile, while another linked profile still receives them.
Here’s how it works
.
Is this feature good for family chiropractic visits?
Yes, it’s perfect for that! Let me show you how that workflow would look.
If you’ve set up your client Relationships, we can head to the schedule. The family chiropractic visits will be double-booked on the schedule. (We don’t want to use Group Appointments because those only give us one invoice with each participant listed, and in this case, we want everyone to have their own invoice.)
You’ll want to Arrive all the double-booked appointments for each family member, then click on the appointment for the person who’s paying and click the
Pay
button:
We’ll see that other family members have an outstanding balance and we’ll view them by clicking Show:
Next, we’ll check off the visits we’d like to pay for, or simply click Select All, and then click Next:
From here, we’ll choose our payment method, hit that Pay button, and we’re done! 🎉
Can related profiles now use each other’s account credit?
You bet they can! A family member with a credit on file can have the credit applied to another family member’s appointment.
The only difference with this workflow compared to the scenarios I’ve outlined above is that we
always
have to click the Pay button from the payer’s profile or appointment in order to use their account credit.
Let’s say we’re using Albert’s credit for Baby Bert’s visit. We would need to go to Albert’s account and take payment from there in order to use his credit.
We’ll click on Albert’s
“Private Outstanding”
balance to pay for an invoice.
Albert’s outstanding balance is $0.00 in this case, but that’s ok! On the first Receive Payment screen, we’ll have the option of paying for Baby Bert’s outstanding invoice:
On the second Receive Payment screen, we can choose Albert’s Account Credit as the payment method:
Now, all we have to do is hit the Pay button and we’re all done!
Can I disable a Relationship if needed?
Absolutely! You can always head to a client’s profile, scroll down to the Relationships section, and click the
trash bin icon
to remove the Relationship, or the pencil icon to edit the Relationship:
Do clients receive a notification when their Relationship permissions are changed administratively?
Yes, for privacy and security reasons, clients receive an email when their Relationship permissions are changed to let them know a change has been made to their account.
Can a parent pay for two children in one transaction (when the parent has not had an appointment)?
They certainly can! One consideration is that in this case, we’ll want to click the Pay button from the parent’s profile so the payment will be listed on the parent’s profile and the invoices will be listed on the individual children’s profiles.
Can a client pay for a related profile online from their My Account area?
The short answer is “no”, Albert would not be able to log into his own account and pay for Baby Bert’s balance online. However, if the clinic has Jane Payments enabled, and Albert has permission to pay for Baby Bert’s session, then Albert could pay for Baby Bert’s session with a saved credit card he has on file so long as Albert is logged in to Baby Bert’s account.

Balance Plan
Practice Plan
Thrive PlanWhether a parent is paying for a minor or paying for multiple invoices at once for a family chiro visit, Jane can accurately reflect the payer of an invoice (and the payment method) when one client is paying for someone else.
For those of you who’ve been running with Jane for a while, you might remember having to use a gift card workaround in order to use one client’s account credit for a related client. Feel free to use up any gift card balances from that old workaround before switching to this new and improved workflow.
To use this feature, you’ll first need to set up a Relationship on your clients’ profiles. I’ll show you how to do that first, and then we’ll go through the two common scenarios below in more detail:
Setting up a Relationship
Scenario 1: A client pays for a related client’s invoice
Scenario 2: A client pays for their own invoice and a related client’s invoice
FAQ
Step 1: Setting up a Relationship
In order to use the Payments for Related Clients feature, you’ll first want to link client profiles with the Relationships feature. Here’s our
guide
on how to set this up. This will allow us to specify who can pay for someone’s visit, along with a few other Relationship options.
Jane tip
💡: For privacy and security purposes, an email notification is sent to clients whenever their information becomes shared via a Relationship — specifically, when a relationship is set up or edited in a way that grants a family member new access to the client’s personal information.
Scenario 1: A client pays for a related client’s invoice
Let’s use Albert and his son, Baby Bert, as examples. Baby Bert is done with his treatment and he’s feeling refreshed. Let’s pay for his visit so he can go home and enjoy a well-deserved nap.
If you’re working from the schedule view, you can select Baby Bert’s appointment, and click the
Pay
button in the upper-right:
This brings us to the Receive Payment screen, where we can select any outstanding invoices for Baby Bert that we’d like to pay for in this transaction. In this case, Baby Bert just has one outstanding invoice to pay, so we’ll click the blue
Next
button:
On the second Receive Payment screen, we choose our payment method, and then we can select a different payer:
Payments and Invoices
This feature has no effect on how invoices are generated. When we arrive an appointment, Jane knows to generate the invoice on the profile of the client who received the service.
The client’s
account
or
appointment
we
click the Pay button from
will be the profile the payment is listed on.
Here’s what that looks like on the Invoice:
Scenario 2: A client pays for their own invoice and a related client’s invoice
📣 Quick tip: If you’re a chiropractic clinic offering family chiro visits, then you’ll want to double-book your appointments and use this workflow to settle up all outstanding invoices with a single payment (if one person’s covering the bill 😉). There’s more on this workflow in the FAQ below.
Albert and Baby Bert are each getting a treatment today, and we’ve arrived both of their visits.
If we’re on the schedule view, we can select Albert’s appointment since he’s the one paying for both visits and click the
Pay
button in the upper-right corner.
Since we’ve clicked the
Pay
button from
Albert’s
appointment panel, the entire payment he makes will live on his profile.
On the Receive Payment screen, we’ll see the message that an additional outstanding balance for a related profile is available. We’ll click Show to see the invoice:
This shows us the details for the outstanding invoice and if we want to pay for it in this transaction, we’ll check off the box to the right:
On the second Receive Payment screen, we’ll already have Albert selected as the payer, so we can just take payment as normal:
Invoices and Payments
This feature has no effect on how invoices are generated. Once we arrive an appointment, the invoice is generated on the profile of the client who received the service. So in this case, both Albert and Baby Bert have separate invoices.
The client’s account or appointment where we click the
Pay
button will be the profile the
payment
is listed on.
FAQ
Whose profile does a payment show up under?
Whose profile does an invoice show up under?
I don’t want my child to receive financial texts or emails, how can I set that up?
Is this workflow good for family chiropractic visits?
Can related profiles now use each other’s account credit?
Can I disable a relationship if needed?
Do clients receive a notification when their relationship permissions are changed administratively?
Can a parent pay for two (or more) children in one transaction (when the parent has not had an appointment)?
Can a client pay for a related profile online from their My Account area?
Whose profile does a payment show up under?
The profile a payment is listed on will depend on whose appointment (or profile) we click the Pay button from.
Whose profile does an invoice show up under?
As always, once we click the
Arrive
button on an appointment, Jane generates an invoice on the client’s profile who received the service.
I don’t want my child to receive financial texts or emails, how can I set that up?
Excellent question. We have a setting that can turn off financial communications for one patient profile, while another linked profile still receives them.
Here’s how it works
.
Is this feature good for family chiropractic visits?
Yes, it’s perfect for that! Let me show you how that workflow would look.
If you’ve set up your client Relationships, we can head to the schedule. The family chiropractic visits will be double-booked on the schedule. (We don’t want to use Group Appointments because those only give us one invoice with each participant listed, and in this case, we want everyone to have their own invoice.)
You’ll want to Arrive all the double-booked appointments for each family member, then click on the appointment for the person who’s paying and click the
Pay
button:
We’ll see that other family members have an outstanding balance and we’ll view them by clicking Show:
Next, we’ll check off the visits we’d like to pay for, or simply click Select All, and then click Next:
From here, we’ll choose our payment method, hit that Pay button, and we’re done! 🎉
Can related profiles now use each other’s account credit?
You bet they can! A family member with a credit on file can have the credit applied to another family member’s appointment.
The only difference with this workflow compared to the scenarios I’ve outlined above is that we
always
have to click the Pay button from the payer’s profile or appointment in order to use their account credit.
Let’s say we’re using Albert’s credit for Baby Bert’s visit. We would need to go to Albert’s account and take payment from there in order to use his credit.
We’ll click on Albert’s
“Private Outstanding”
balance to pay for an invoice.
Albert’s outstanding balance is $0.00 in this case, but that’s ok! On the first Receive Payment screen, we’ll have the option of paying for Baby Bert’s outstanding invoice:
On the second Receive Payment screen, we can choose Albert’s Account Credit as the payment method:
Now, all we have to do is hit the Pay button and we’re all done!
Can I disable a Relationship if needed?
Absolutely! You can always head to a client’s profile, scroll down to the Relationships section, and click the
trash bin icon
to remove the Relationship, or the pencil icon to edit the Relationship:
Do clients receive a notification when their Relationship permissions are changed administratively?
Yes, for privacy and security reasons, clients receive an email when their Relationship permissions are changed to let them know a change has been made to their account.
Can a parent pay for two children in one transaction (when the parent has not had an appointment)?
They certainly can! One consideration is that in this case, we’ll want to click the Pay button from the parent’s profile so the payment will be listed on the parent’s profile and the invoices will be listed on the individual children’s profiles.
Can a client pay for a related profile online from their My Account area?
The short answer is “no”, Albert would not be able to log into his own account and pay for Baby Bert’s balance online. However, if the clinic has Jane Payments enabled, and Albert has permission to pay for Baby Bert’s session, then Albert could pay for Baby Bert’s session with a saved credit card he has on file so long as Albert is logged in to Baby Bert’s account.
