Welcome to our guide on Treatment Plans. This feature helps you organize your chart entries and track the number of appointments for a patient’s specific concern.
We also want to offer a wider lens to view your whole caseload with the
Treatment Plans Report
. You can see which plans are open and how many of the suggested visits your patients have had. This gives you an easier way to review your overall caseload and patients’ progress.
❗️
Please note, Treatment Plans are an insurance-related feature and are not a part of our Legacy Base Plan. If you are on a Legacy Base Plan and would like to make use of this feature, you can switch to any of our current pricing plans. For more info, check out our
Pricing page
.

FAQ
Create a Treatment Plan
Start by heading to a patient’s charting area, either from the Day view or from their profile. Next, you’ll click the
New Treatment Plan
button to the right:
Next, you can fill in the Treatment Plan Name which is the only required field. You can add up to three diagnosis codes.
You can also suggest a visit count so when you add a chart to the plan that’s linked to an appointment, Jane will keep track of how many times the patient has come in for this particular issue.
On that note, we recommend making one treatment plan per discipline-specific concern. So for example, if a patient is recovering from a car accident and seeing multiple different practitioners at the clinic for different injuries stemming from that accident, they would have separate treatment plans for each injury. This helps you keep track of the number of treatments and the progress for each issue.
Lastly, click
Create Treatment Plan
. Voila! You’ve just opened your first plan in Jane.
📣
Please note
that any practitioner with access to the patient’s profile will be able to see the Treatment Plan including the author’s name, Treatment Plan Name, diagnosis codes, date the plan was created, and how many appointments and charts are attached. However, practitioners will not be able to view charts they don’t have access to.
In the example below, we’re logged in as the Demo Owner and viewing patient #90’s charting area. We can see there’s a Treatment Plan that Dr. Marcus created, and we can see the Treatment Plan Name, diagnosis codes, and how many charts and appointments are attached to the plan. We can see one chart by Dr. Maya, but we can’t view the second chart as we don’t have access to it.
Add and Remove Charts From a Treatment Plan
Creating a new chart from within the Treatment Plan
If you are creating a
new chart entry
that you’d like to add to a patient’s Treatment Plan, you can start by clicking the
Actions
dropdown next to the plan and then selecting
New Entry
:
Next, you can start selecting chart parts or use one of your chart templates:
Once you’ve completed the chart entry, you can sign and lock it as usual. All done!
Adding an existing chart to a Treatment Plan
If you have an existing chart entry you’d like to add to a Treatment Plan, you can click the down arrow next to a chart and select
move to plan
.
If the patient only has one open Treatment Plan, then the chart will automatically be assigned to that plan. If there are multiple open Treatment Plans, you can select which one the chart gets assigned to.
Removing a chart from a Treatment Plan
To remove a chart from a treatment plan, you can head to the patient’s charting area and click on the Treatment Plan. Next, click the down arrow next to the chart author and select
Remove from plan
.
Add Appointments to a Treatment Plan
In order for an appointment to be counted in the appointment tracker of a Treatment Plan, it must be arrived and linked to a chart entry in the plan.
If you’d like your appointment to be automatically linked to your chart entry, you’ll want to chart in the Day tab of your account as covered in our
Day View: Sign and Lock Workflow
guide.
Alternatively, if you need to manually link an appointment to a chart entry you can check out the last section of our
Appointment Charting Status
guide.
Edit, Close, Delete, or Export a Treatment Plan
When you need to make an update to the plan as your patient progresses, or if their issue has been resolved, click the Actions button and select:
Edit Plan
if you would like to update the diagnosis or number of suggested visits.
Close Plan
if you wish to change the status of the plan.
Delete Plan
if it was created by accident. First you’ll need to remove any chart entries in the plan by clicking the down arrow next to the chart and selecting Remove from plan
Export/Print
if you need to export the chart entries in the plan
Treatment Plans Report
The Treatment Plans Report offers you a zoomed-out view of your caseload so you can stay on top of your patient’s progress.
This report shows you the following information:
A list of all patients with Treatment Plans
The status of each plan: Open or Closed
The diagnosis codes
How many visits they’ve had and how many are suggested
Their first and last attended appointment
Exported reports will also include columns for diagnosis codes and patient numbers
To get started, head to
Reports
on the top blue bar and click
Treatments Plans
in the Care category.
You can filter by diagnosis code, the status of the plan, or the staff member who authored the plan.
To export the Treatment Plans Report, click the three dots on the right of the report:

Does the Treatment Plans Report include diagnosis codes?
Can I filter the Treatment Plans Report?
Why is a patient not showing up when I filter the report for my name?
Can I send a treatment plan to a patient before their appointment?
Who can view a Treatment Plan?
Any staff member with access to a patient’s profile can view that patient’s Treatment Plans including the author’s name, plan name, diagnosis code, date the plan was created, and how many appointments and charts are attached. However, practitioners will not be able to view charts in the plan that they don’t have access to.
Who can add or remove a chart from a Treatment Plan?
Any staff member with permission to view shared charts can move shared entries in and out of Treatment Plans.
What’s the difference between closing and deleting a Treatment Plan?
Deleting a plan removes it completely from the patient’s charting area. A plan needs to have all charts removed before being deleted and you’d only want to delete a plan that was created by accident.
Closing a plan means that the plan is completed and chart entries cannot be added to it. However, the plan is still available to be exported, viewed, and reopened.
Who can delete, close, or edit a Treatment Plan?
Only the author of the treatment can close, edit, or delete it.
Who can Export a Treatment Plan?
Any staff member with access to view charts in their staff permissions can export a treatment plan. If there are charts within the plan that they don’t have permission to view, those will not be included in the export.
Can more than 1 diagnosis be added to the plan?
Yes, you can add up to three diagnosis codes to a treatment plan. The first code you add will be the primary.
While you can add multiple diagnosis codes, we recommend that you stick with one treatment plan per discipline-specific concern. So for example, if a patient is recovering from a car accident and seeing multiple different practitioners at the clinic for different injuries stemming from that accident, they would have separate treatment plans for each injury. This helps you keep track of the number of treatments and the progress for each issue.
Can someone create their own coding system?
Yes, you can
create custom billing codes
in Jane, which allows the clinic to set up their own ICD-10 labels.
Can I change the diagnosis part way through the plan?
Yes, the author of the Treatment Plan can edit it at any time and change the diagnosis.
Can I re-open a plan?
Yes, closed plans can be re-opened so that more entries may be added.
Can you add a chart entry to a closed plan?
No, plans can be re-opened first so that a chart entry may be added.
Does a chart entry need to be associated with an appointment to be added to a plan?
No, however, the appointment will only be counted in the plan if the appointment is arrived and linked with the chart entry. If there isn’t an appointment connected to the chart entry, Jane will not include the appointment in the count. This is why you may sometimes see a higher chart count than the number of appointments tallied.
For a refresher on how to attach a chart to an appointment, check out the last section of
this guide
.
Does Jane count every appointment state?
No, Jane is specifically looking at arrived (attended) appointments. Jane is also looking to ensure that multiple chart entries that are attached to the same appointment aren’t counted as multiple visits on the appointment counter.
How do we organize the charts within the plan?
The chart entries will continue to follow the same order as we are used to. Starred chart entries will appear at the top of the list followed by the remaining ones from most newest to oldest.
Is there a way to move multiple chart entries into a plan at once?
Not at this time, but we’d like to
hear your feedback
if this is something that would be helpful for you.
Is there a report that can be run to review active patients?
You bet there is! Check out our section above on the
Treatment Plan Report
.
Does the Treatment Plans Report include diagnosis codes?
Yes, it does. You can also filter the report by diagnosis code using the search bar at the top of the report.
Can I filter the Treatment Plans Report?
Yes, you can filter the report by plan status and by practitioner name and it will give you all patients with Treatment Plans that the practitioner has created.
Why is a patient not showing up when I filter the report for my name?
Patients will only show up on the report for your name if you are the author of their Treatment Plan. When viewing the plan, you’ll see the author’s name under the status:
Can I send a treatment plan to a patient before their appointment?
While you won’t be able to share it like a regular chart entry, you can export the plan and send it via a secure document sharing platform or via an encrypted email.

Thrive PlanWelcome to our guide on Treatment Plans. This feature helps you organize your chart entries and track the number of appointments for a patient’s specific concern.
We also want to offer a wider lens to view your whole caseload with the
Treatment Plans Report
. You can see which plans are open and how many of the suggested visits your patients have had. This gives you an easier way to review your overall caseload and patients’ progress.
❗️
Please note, Treatment Plans are an insurance-related feature and are not a part of our Legacy Base Plan. If you are on a Legacy Base Plan and would like to make use of this feature, you can switch to any of our current pricing plans. For more info, check out our
Pricing page
.

Treatment Plans Report
FAQ
Create a Treatment Plan
Start by heading to a patient’s charting area, either from the Day view or from their profile. Next, you’ll click the
New Treatment Plan
button to the right:
Next, you can fill in the Treatment Plan Name which is the only required field. You can add up to three diagnosis codes.
You can also suggest a visit count so when you add a chart to the plan that’s linked to an appointment, Jane will keep track of how many times the patient has come in for this particular issue.
On that note, we recommend making one treatment plan per discipline-specific concern. So for example, if a patient is recovering from a car accident and seeing multiple different practitioners at the clinic for different injuries stemming from that accident, they would have separate treatment plans for each injury. This helps you keep track of the number of treatments and the progress for each issue.
Lastly, click
Create Treatment Plan
. Voila! You’ve just opened your first plan in Jane.
📣
Please note
that any practitioner with access to the patient’s profile will be able to see the Treatment Plan including the author’s name, Treatment Plan Name, diagnosis codes, date the plan was created, and how many appointments and charts are attached. However, practitioners will not be able to view charts they don’t have access to.
In the example below, we’re logged in as the Demo Owner and viewing patient #90’s charting area. We can see there’s a Treatment Plan that Dr. Marcus created, and we can see the Treatment Plan Name, diagnosis codes, and how many charts and appointments are attached to the plan. We can see one chart by Dr. Maya, but we can’t view the second chart as we don’t have access to it.
Add and Remove Charts From a Treatment Plan
Creating a new chart from within the Treatment Plan
If you are creating a
new chart entry
that you’d like to add to a patient’s Treatment Plan, you can start by clicking the
Actions
dropdown next to the plan and then selecting
New Entry
:
Next, you can start selecting chart parts or use one of your chart templates:
Once you’ve completed the chart entry, you can sign and lock it as usual. All done!
Adding an existing chart to a Treatment Plan
If you have an existing chart entry you’d like to add to a Treatment Plan, you can click the down arrow next to a chart and select
move to plan
.
If the patient only has one open Treatment Plan, then the chart will automatically be assigned to that plan. If there are multiple open Treatment Plans, you can select which one the chart gets assigned to.
Removing a chart from a Treatment Plan
To remove a chart from a treatment plan, you can head to the patient’s charting area and click on the Treatment Plan. Next, click the down arrow next to the chart author and select
Remove from plan
.
Add Appointments to a Treatment Plan
In order for an appointment to be counted in the appointment tracker of a Treatment Plan, it must be arrived and linked to a chart entry in the plan.
If you’d like your appointment to be automatically linked to your chart entry, you’ll want to chart in the Day tab of your account as covered in our
Day View: Sign and Lock Workflow
guide.
Alternatively, if you need to manually link an appointment to a chart entry you can check out the last section of our
Appointment Charting Status
guide.
Edit, Close, Delete, or Export a Treatment Plan
When you need to make an update to the plan as your patient progresses, or if their issue has been resolved, click the Actions button and select:
Edit Plan
if you would like to update the diagnosis or number of suggested visits.
Close Plan
if you wish to change the status of the plan.
Delete Plan
if it was created by accident. First you’ll need to remove any chart entries in the plan by clicking the down arrow next to the chart and selecting Remove from plan
Export/Print
if you need to export the chart entries in the plan
Treatment Plans Report
The Treatment Plans Report offers you a zoomed-out view of your caseload so you can stay on top of your patient’s progress.
This report shows you the following information:
A list of all patients with Treatment Plans
The status of each plan: Open or Closed
The diagnosis codes
How many visits they’ve had and how many are suggested
Their first and last attended appointment
Exported reports will also include columns for diagnosis codes and patient numbers
To get started, head to
Reports
on the top blue bar and click
Treatments Plans
in the Care category.
You can filter by diagnosis code, the status of the plan, or the staff member who authored the plan.
To export the Treatment Plans Report, click the three dots on the right of the report:

Does the Treatment Plans Report include diagnosis codes?
Can I filter the Treatment Plans Report?
Why is a patient not showing up when I filter the report for my name?
Can I send a treatment plan to a patient before their appointment?
Who can view a Treatment Plan?
Any staff member with access to a patient’s profile can view that patient’s Treatment Plans including the author’s name, plan name, diagnosis code, date the plan was created, and how many appointments and charts are attached. However, practitioners will not be able to view charts in the plan that they don’t have access to.
Who can add or remove a chart from a Treatment Plan?
Any staff member with permission to view shared charts can move shared entries in and out of Treatment Plans.
What’s the difference between closing and deleting a Treatment Plan?
Deleting a plan removes it completely from the patient’s charting area. A plan needs to have all charts removed before being deleted and you’d only want to delete a plan that was created by accident.
Closing a plan means that the plan is completed and chart entries cannot be added to it. However, the plan is still available to be exported, viewed, and reopened.
Who can delete, close, or edit a Treatment Plan?
Only the author of the treatment can close, edit, or delete it.
Who can Export a Treatment Plan?
Any staff member with access to view charts in their staff permissions can export a treatment plan. If there are charts within the plan that they don’t have permission to view, those will not be included in the export.
Can more than 1 diagnosis be added to the plan?
Yes, you can add up to three diagnosis codes to a treatment plan. The first code you add will be the primary.
While you can add multiple diagnosis codes, we recommend that you stick with one treatment plan per discipline-specific concern. So for example, if a patient is recovering from a car accident and seeing multiple different practitioners at the clinic for different injuries stemming from that accident, they would have separate treatment plans for each injury. This helps you keep track of the number of treatments and the progress for each issue.
Can someone create their own coding system?
Yes, you can
create custom billing codes
in Jane, which allows the clinic to set up their own ICD-10 labels.
Can I change the diagnosis part way through the plan?
Yes, the author of the Treatment Plan can edit it at any time and change the diagnosis.
Can I re-open a plan?
Yes, closed plans can be re-opened so that more entries may be added.
Can you add a chart entry to a closed plan?
No, plans can be re-opened first so that a chart entry may be added.
Does a chart entry need to be associated with an appointment to be added to a plan?
No, however, the appointment will only be counted in the plan if the appointment is arrived and linked with the chart entry. If there isn’t an appointment connected to the chart entry, Jane will not include the appointment in the count. This is why you may sometimes see a higher chart count than the number of appointments tallied.
For a refresher on how to attach a chart to an appointment, check out the last section of
this guide
.
Does Jane count every appointment state?
No, Jane is specifically looking at arrived (attended) appointments. Jane is also looking to ensure that multiple chart entries that are attached to the same appointment aren’t counted as multiple visits on the appointment counter.
How do we organize the charts within the plan?
The chart entries will continue to follow the same order as we are used to. Starred chart entries will appear at the top of the list followed by the remaining ones from most newest to oldest.
Is there a way to move multiple chart entries into a plan at once?
Not at this time, but we’d like to
hear your feedback
if this is something that would be helpful for you.
Is there a report that can be run to review active patients?
You bet there is! Check out our section above on the
Treatment Plan Report
.
Does the Treatment Plans Report include diagnosis codes?
Yes, it does. You can also filter the report by diagnosis code using the search bar at the top of the report.
Can I filter the Treatment Plans Report?
Yes, you can filter the report by plan status and by practitioner name and it will give you all patients with Treatment Plans that the practitioner has created.
Why is a patient not showing up when I filter the report for my name?
Patients will only show up on the report for your name if you are the author of their Treatment Plan. When viewing the plan, you’ll see the author’s name under the status:
Can I send a treatment plan to a patient before their appointment?
While you won’t be able to share it like a regular chart entry, you can export the plan and send it via a secure document sharing platform or via an encrypted email.Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.
