Have a read through these, and stay tuned for some links at the bottom of this Guide to some additional resources to help you get set up and on your way with Ratings and Reviews.\nAccess and Permissions\nWhat access level is required to enable Ratings and Reviews?\nDo all staff members have permission to see practitioners’ internal ratings and reviews?\nWill my account be opted-out of Ratings and Reviews by default?\nArriving Appointments\nYikes, I just unarrived - then rearrived the same appointment for a patient. Will they get two surveys?\nIf I arrive an appointment early, will Jane send the survey to the client earlier too?\nWhat if I arrive then unarrive a\npast\nappointment? Is this any different?\nSettings for Multi-Practitioner Clinics\nIf “request feedback after 5 visits” is selected, and if the patient sees multiple practitioners at the clinic, does Jane know the difference between visit #5 with Practitioner A vs. Practitioner B?\nIf “Request Visit after Initial Visit” is selected, does Jane know that it is a unique initial visit with Practitioner A vs. Practitioner B?\nReceiving Surveys and Opting-Out\nDoes the clinic have the option to opt-out a specific patient from receiving surveys from the clinic?\nDo individual patients have the option to opt-out of receiving surveys?\nI’m a guardian/parent of a minor and I’d like to provide feedback to the clinic for my child’s appointment. Will I receive this email?\nGoogle Reviews\nI have Google Reviews enabled for my clinic. Will Jane automatically help me post my reviews to Google as well?\nI’m a practitioner at a multi-disciplinary clinic. I’m not allowed to use Google Reviews as per my Regulatory Body’s Standards of Practice, but others in my clinic are allowed to. What does this mean for our clinic’s Ratings & Reviews settings?\nI’m using Google Reviews. If a client’s feedback is posted to Google as well, will the clinic or staff member be notified?\nCan I customize my text so that my patient can read my personalized note before proceeding to post on Google?\nIf I have Google Reviews enabled, does my client get prompted to leave a review for any star rating from 1-5?\nDoes my regulatory body allow me to publicly market patient testimonials online?\nGeneral\nWhy didn’t my patient receive a Ratings email?\nCan I manually send a rating email to a patient?\nAccess and Permissions\nWhat access level is required to enable Ratings and Reviews?\nYou’ll need to be the Account Owner or have Full Access to enable Ratings & Reviews within Settings.\nDo all staff members have permission to see practitioners’ internal ratings and reviews?\nOnly\nFull Access & Administrative/All Billing\nhave access to see each staff member’s ratings and reviews at the clinic. Here’s a nifty little table we put together to display the Role and Access:\nWill my account be opted-out of Ratings and Reviews by default?\nYes - when Jane made ratings and reviews available to all clinics, clinics will have the feature disabled by default. You will need to actively enable it via Settings > Ratings & Reviews.\nOne thing to mention is that all existing patients will be opted-in to the Ratings & Review email – however, the email\nwill not send\nunless the feature has been enabled.\nArriving Appointments\nYikes, I just unarrived - then rearrived the same appointment for a patient. Will they get two surveys?\nJane will not send out a second rating email if one has already gone out. In other words, you will not be able to manually generate a\nnew\nsurvey by un-arriving then re-arriving an appointment in Jane.\nIf I arrive an appointment early, will Jane send the survey to the client earlier too?\nYou can arrive an appointment anytime before the appointment start time and Jane will still wait for 3-hours after the appointment end time to send the survey.\nWhat if I arrive then unarrive a\npast\nappointment? Is this any different?\nNope! If Jane already sent the Rating email once in the past for the appointment, Jane will not send it again.\nSettings for Multi-Practitioner Clinics\nIf “request feedback after 5 visits” is selected, and if the patient sees multiple practitioners at the clinic, does Jane know the difference between visit #5 with Practitioner A vs. Practitioner B?\nAbsolutely! Jane counts visits with the selected practitioner and the specific treatment. So the number of visits for patient Z with Practitioner A and Practitioner B could be different, and the survey will send out according to this set-up.\nIf “Request Visit after First Visit” is selected, does Jane know that it is a unique first appointment with Practitioner A vs. Practitioner B?\nYou got it! Jane knows to look at the first treatment with the specific Practitioner and that specific treatment type. So, a client could receive two surveys linked to each first visits with Practitioner A, and Practitioner B. This allows each practitioner to know how the patient rated their first experience with them.\nReceiving Surveys and Opting-Out\nDoes the clinic have the option to opt-out a specific patient from receiving Ratings & Reviews from the clinic?\nYes! By default, when creating a new patient, the new patient will be\nopted-in\nto receive Ratings & Reviews emails. This can be turned off administratively by clicking\nEdit / Settings\nwithin the patient’s profile, and\nunchecking\nthe *Send Ratings Emails** box.\nDo individual patients have the option to opt-out of receiving Ratings & Reviews emails?\nIndividual patients can opt-out of receiving these emails. In their\nMy Account\n, they have an option to\nuncheck\nthe option for\nI would like to provide my feedback on my experience\n, under their Notifications & Reminders.\nI’m a guardian/parent of a minor and I’d like to provide feedback to the clinic for my child’s appointment. Will I receive this email?\nIf the guardian/parent is set-up to receive the minor’s emails & notifications via Jane’s\nFamily Relationship\nfeature, they will also receive the Rating email.\nGoogle Reviews\nI have Google Reviews enabled for my clinic. Will Jane automatically help me post my reviews to Google as well?\nWe wish we could but Google doesn’t allow any software to post reviews automatically. Google wants users to post their own reviews with their own Google accounts to prevent companies from creating less-than-credible ratings and reviews. They also want to make sure it’s really you. Imagine if you as a patient found out a practitioner posted a review in your name!\nWe make it easy for patients to leave a review on Google. Once they complete their star rating, they can simply click to “Open Google Review”. This will open your Google Review page for them, all setup ready for their review. To see how that looks, read more about it\nin the guide here\n.\nI’m a practitioner at a multi-disciplinary clinic. I’m not allowed to use Google Reviews as per my Regulatory Body’s Standards of Practice, but others in my clinic are allowed to. What does this mean for our clinic’s Ratings & Reviews settings?\nGoogle reviews is a\nclinic-wide\nrule. With this in mind, we’ve put together one scenario and two possible setting options for clinics that may fall under this category.\nScenario: I am a multi-disciplinary clinic with 1 Discipline that is\nallowed\nto collect external Google Reviews, and 1 Discipline that is\nnot approved to\n.\nSettings Option 1\n:\nInternal Feedback enabled for all practitioners ✅\nExternal Google Reviews disabled for all practitioners 🚫\nSettings Option 2\n:\nInternal Feedback enabled for\nonly those practitioners who also are approved for Google Reviews\n✅\nExternal Google Reviews enabled ✅\nI’m using Google Reviews. If a client’s feedback is posted to Google as well, will the clinic or staff member be notified?\nYou’ll be able to see when a patient has clicked the “Rate Your Experience” survey from the patient\nCommunications\ntab, however, we don’t know if they’ve actually left a review in Google.\nLooking at Google will always be the best option albeit you won’t be able to see if the patient came directly from Jane. This is a development we may look into in the future based on clinic feedback.\nCan I customize my text so that my patient can read my personalized note before proceeding to post on Google?\nYes, you now have two customization options! 1. For ratings between 1-3, and 2. For ratings between 4-5.\nYou can find the customization under\nSettings > Ratings & Reviews\nor\nvia Settings > Language\nHere’s the location of this customized text:\nIf I have Google Reviews enabled, does my client get prompted to leave a review for any star rating from 1-5?\nYes\n, Google now requires that any star rating (between 1-5) prompts a Google Review, so we have now gone ahead and implemented this change in Jane. It’s a change that Google made to increase the authenticity and trust of Google Reviews (which is a good thing for all of us consumers!).\nIf Google thinks that we are only sending over positive reviews from Jane, then Google can pull those reviews off of your business listing and block Jane as a referrer of reviews.\nDoes my regulatory body allow me to publicly market patient testimonials online?\nJane is working hard on creating a region-specific list with some easy to digest information based on different regulatory bodys’ marketing standards.\nWe are not lawyers nor are we equipped to interpret licensing regulations and bylaws. You should confirm with your regulating body that our summary of the regulations linked below are accurate.\nWe’ll be starting with Canada (BC, AB, ON). However, we do want to emphasize that if there is any uncertainty, please do get in touch with your regulatory body directly to get a more definite answer. And as always, we’d love to hear from you to see what resolution was reached so that we can update this guide document accordingly.\nBritish Columbia\nDiscipline\nCan I use Google Reviews?\nStandards of Practice\nNaturopathic Doctors\nNo\nLink\nRegistered Massage Therapist\nPossibly\nLink\nChiropractor\nYes\nLink\nPhysiotherapist\nPossibly\nLink\nAcupuncture\nPossibly. Please refer to pages 48-50 of the bylaws, which indicate\n      practitioners need to watch the content of the reviews closely.\nLink\nCounsellor\nUnlikely, due to association requirements.

Here are some reasons why:\nThe patient’s appointment was not marked as\nArrived\n(this includes No Show, cancelled/deleted, and unarrived appointments as Jane won’t send a Ratings email for an appointment that did not occur)\nThe patient’s is arrived\nafter\nthe calendar date of the appointment. For example, if an appointment is booked for August 18th, but is not marked as arrived until  August 19th, then Jane will not send out a notification.\nThe patient has “Do Not Email” selected in their profile\nThe patient has opted out of Ratings emails in their My Account\nThe patient has no email address or an invalid email\nThe practitioner is not opted into the clinic’s Ratings and Reviews settings.\nCan I manually send a ratings email to a patient?\nNo\n, at the moment there isn’t a way to manually resend these emails to clients and are only automatically prompted after the appointment is marked as arrived.\nAdditional Resources\nIf you haven’t seen them already, we have a handful of ratings & reviews guides on several topics:\nHow to Setup Ratings & Reviews\nReview Your Ratings (for Practitioners)\nFilling out a Rating Survey (for Patients)\nSetting up your location for Google Reviews\nAs always, we love hearing from you!\nYou can reach out to us here\n.\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter.\nWelcome\nWelcome to the Jane Guide\nCode of Conduct\nFeature Requests\nJane's Brand Assets\nAccount Setup Consultations\nWhat's new in Jane?\nWhat's new in Jane Webinar\nJane's Changelog\nJane's Monthly Newsletter\nUpdates to Interchange Fees for Visa & Mastercard in Canada 🇨🇦\nHoward Spector joins Jane!\nJane Appoints Dan Davidow as Chief Marketing Officer\nJane App's Support Team Wins a Bronze Stevie® Award\nDemo Videos\nPractitioner's Home Base: Day Sheets & Charts\nJane in Action\nPractitioner Training:  Initial Signing In and Overview\nInsurance: Billing a Visit to a 3rd Party\nScheduling: Managing the Schedule with Many Practitioners\nDisciplines, Treatments, & Billing Settings\nSetting up Staff & Scheduling Shifts\nCharting: Signing, Duplicating & Symbols\nScheduling: Complete Schedule Overview\nBilling: Accepting Payments\nLaunching an Insurer Portal\nQuick Start\nStep 1: Clinic Information\nStep 2: Disciplines\nStep 3: Treatments\nStep 4: Staff\nStep 5: Schedule or Diary\nAdditional Set Up Recommendations\nPractitioner Step 1: Practitioner Training\nPractitioner Step 2: Treatments\nPractitioner Step 3: Shifts\nPractitioner Step 4: Online Booking\nPractitioner Step 5: Charting\nAccount Setup Consultations\nSwitching to Jane\nSwitching is easy with Jane on your team\nJane vs. SimplePractice\nAccount Basics\nHow To Check Who's Listed As Account Owner\nChecklist for Starting with Jane\nBrowser Requirements\nDevice & Network Recommendations\nUsing Jane on a Tablet\nUsing Jane on a Smartphone\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nAuto-Logout Duration\nUpdating Your Clinic Email Address & Phone Number\nLog In Help: Username and Password\nEnabling Patient Self Check-in\nAdding a Location\nBooking  a Break on a Mobile Device (Phone or other Small Screen)\nMoving Your Practice to a New Location\nMultiple Locations or Multiple Accounts: How to Set Up Jane for Independent Locations or Practitioners\nAccessibility in Jane\nI Can't Access My Jane Account: A Troubleshooting Guide\nHow to Archive a Treatment, Class or Group Appointment\nBookmarking Your Jane Account for Easy Access\nViewing Protected Financial Documents (For Patients)\nSwitching to the Balance Plan\nAdding a Billing Address for Locations\nUnauthorized Access: What to Do if Your Laptop/Phone is Lost or Stolen\nHow to Archive/Unarchive a Discipline\nHow to Change the Name of Your Clinic\nImporting to Jane\nHow to Import Data to Jane (Overview)\nBasics of Importing to Jane\nDiving Deeper Into Importing to Jane\nWhere Can You Import From?

Have a read through these, and stay tuned for some links at the bottom of this Guide to some additional resources to help you get set up and on your way with Ratings and Reviews.\nAccess and Permissions\nWhat access level is required to enable Ratings and Reviews?\nDo all staff members have permission to see practitioners’ internal ratings and reviews?\nWill my account be opted-out of Ratings and Reviews by default?\nArriving Appointments\nYikes, I just unarrived - then rearrived the same appointment for a patient. Will they get two surveys?\nIf I arrive an appointment early, will Jane send the survey to the client earlier too?\nWhat if I arrive then unarrive a\npast\nappointment? Is this any different?\nSettings for Multi-Practitioner Clinics\nIf “request feedback after 5 visits” is selected, and if the patient sees multiple practitioners at the clinic, does Jane know the difference between visit #5 with Practitioner A vs. Practitioner B?\nIf “Request Visit after Initial Visit” is selected, does Jane know that it is a unique initial visit with Practitioner A vs. Practitioner B?\nReceiving Surveys and Opting-Out\nDoes the clinic have the option to opt-out a specific patient from receiving surveys from the clinic?\nDo individual patients have the option to opt-out of receiving surveys?\nI’m a guardian/parent of a minor and I’d like to provide feedback to the clinic for my child’s appointment. Will I receive this email?\nGoogle Reviews\nI have Google Reviews enabled for my clinic. Will Jane automatically help me post my reviews to Google as well?\nI’m a practitioner at a multi-disciplinary clinic. I’m not allowed to use Google Reviews as per my Regulatory Body’s Standards of Practice, but others in my clinic are allowed to. What does this mean for our clinic’s Ratings & Reviews settings?\nI’m using Google Reviews. If a client’s feedback is posted to Google as well, will the clinic or staff member be notified?\nCan I customize my text so that my patient can read my personalized note before proceeding to post on Google?\nIf I have Google Reviews enabled, does my client get prompted to leave a review for any star rating from 1-5?\nDoes my regulatory body allow me to publicly market patient testimonials online?\nGeneral\nWhy didn’t my patient receive a Ratings email?\nCan I manually send a rating email to a patient?\nAccess and Permissions\nWhat access level is required to enable Ratings and Reviews?\nYou’ll need to be the Account Owner or have Full Access to enable Ratings & Reviews within Settings.\nDo all staff members have permission to see practitioners’ internal ratings and reviews?\nOnly\nFull Access & Administrative/All Billing\nhave access to see each staff member’s ratings and reviews at the clinic. Here’s a nifty little table we put together to display the Role and Access:\nWill my account be opted-out of Ratings and Reviews by default?\nYes - when Jane made ratings and reviews available to all clinics, clinics will have the feature disabled by default. You will need to actively enable it via Settings > Ratings & Reviews.\nOne thing to mention is that all existing patients will be opted-in to the Ratings & Review email – however, the email\nwill not send\nunless the feature has been enabled.\nArriving Appointments\nYikes, I just unarrived - then rearrived the same appointment for a patient. Will they get two surveys?\nJane will not send out a second rating email if one has already gone out. In other words, you will not be able to manually generate a\nnew\nsurvey by un-arriving then re-arriving an appointment in Jane.\nIf I arrive an appointment early, will Jane send the survey to the client earlier too?\nYou can arrive an appointment anytime before the appointment start time and Jane will still wait for 3-hours after the appointment end time to send the survey.\nWhat if I arrive then unarrive a\npast\nappointment? Is this any different?\nNope! If Jane already sent the Rating email once in the past for the appointment, Jane will not send it again.\nSettings for Multi-Practitioner Clinics\nIf “request feedback after 5 visits” is selected, and if the patient sees multiple practitioners at the clinic, does Jane know the difference between visit #5 with Practitioner A vs. Practitioner B?\nAbsolutely! Jane counts visits with the selected practitioner and the specific treatment. So the number of visits for patient Z with Practitioner A and Practitioner B could be different, and the survey will send out according to this set-up.\nIf “Request Visit after First Visit” is selected, does Jane know that it is a unique first appointment with Practitioner A vs. Practitioner B?\nYou got it! Jane knows to look at the first treatment with the specific Practitioner and that specific treatment type. So, a client could receive two surveys linked to each first visits with Practitioner A, and Practitioner B. This allows each practitioner to know how the patient rated their first experience with them.\nReceiving Surveys and Opting-Out\nDoes the clinic have the option to opt-out a specific patient from receiving Ratings & Reviews from the clinic?\nYes! By default, when creating a new patient, the new patient will be\nopted-in\nto receive Ratings & Reviews emails. This can be turned off administratively by clicking\nEdit / Settings\nwithin the patient’s profile, and\nunchecking\nthe *Send Ratings Emails** box.\nDo individual patients have the option to opt-out of receiving Ratings & Reviews emails?\nIndividual patients can opt-out of receiving these emails. In their\nMy Account\n, they have an option to\nuncheck\nthe option for\nI would like to provide my feedback on my experience\n, under their Notifications & Reminders.\nI’m a guardian/parent of a minor and I’d like to provide feedback to the clinic for my child’s appointment. Will I receive this email?\nIf the guardian/parent is set-up to receive the minor’s emails & notifications via Jane’s\nFamily Relationship\nfeature, they will also receive the Rating email.\nGoogle Reviews\nI have Google Reviews enabled for my clinic. Will Jane automatically help me post my reviews to Google as well?\nWe wish we could but Google doesn’t allow any software to post reviews automatically. Google wants users to post their own reviews with their own Google accounts to prevent companies from creating less-than-credible ratings and reviews. They also want to make sure it’s really you. Imagine if you as a patient found out a practitioner posted a review in your name!\nWe make it easy for patients to leave a review on Google. Once they complete their star rating, they can simply click to “Open Google Review”. This will open your Google Review page for them, all setup ready for their review. To see how that looks, read more about it\nin the guide here\n.\nI’m a practitioner at a multi-disciplinary clinic. I’m not allowed to use Google Reviews as per my Regulatory Body’s Standards of Practice, but others in my clinic are allowed to. What does this mean for our clinic’s Ratings & Reviews settings?\nGoogle reviews is a\nclinic-wide\nrule. With this in mind, we’ve put together one scenario and two possible setting options for clinics that may fall under this category.\nScenario: I am a multi-disciplinary clinic with 1 Discipline that is\nallowed\nto collect external Google Reviews, and 1 Discipline that is\nnot approved to\n.\nSettings Option 1\n:\nInternal Feedback enabled for all practitioners ✅\nExternal Google Reviews disabled for all practitioners 🚫\nSettings Option 2\n:\nInternal Feedback enabled for\nonly those practitioners who also are approved for Google Reviews\n✅\nExternal Google Reviews enabled ✅\nI’m using Google Reviews. If a client’s feedback is posted to Google as well, will the clinic or staff member be notified?\nYou’ll be able to see when a patient has clicked the “Rate Your Experience” survey from the patient\nCommunications\ntab, however, we don’t know if they’ve actually left a review in Google.\nLooking at Google will always be the best option albeit you won’t be able to see if the patient came directly from Jane. This is a development we may look into in the future based on clinic feedback.\nCan I customize my text so that my patient can read my personalized note before proceeding to post on Google?\nYes, you now have two customization options! 1. For ratings between 1-3, and 2. For ratings between 4-5.\nYou can find the customization under\nSettings > Ratings & Reviews\nor\nvia Settings > Language\nHere’s the location of this customized text:\nIf I have Google Reviews enabled, does my client get prompted to leave a review for any star rating from 1-5?\nYes\n, Google now requires that any star rating (between 1-5) prompts a Google Review, so we have now gone ahead and implemented this change in Jane. It’s a change that Google made to increase the authenticity and trust of Google Reviews (which is a good thing for all of us consumers!).\nIf Google thinks that we are only sending over positive reviews from Jane, then Google can pull those reviews off of your business listing and block Jane as a referrer of reviews.\nDoes my regulatory body allow me to publicly market patient testimonials online?\nJane is working hard on creating a region-specific list with some easy to digest information based on different regulatory bodys’ marketing standards.\nWe are not lawyers nor are we equipped to interpret licensing regulations and bylaws. You should confirm with your regulating body that our summary of the regulations linked below are accurate.\nWe’ll be starting with Canada (BC, AB, ON). However, we do want to emphasize that if there is any uncertainty, please do get in touch with your regulatory body directly to get a more definite answer. And as always, we’d love to hear from you to see what resolution was reached so that we can update this guide document accordingly.\nBritish Columbia\nDiscipline\nCan I use Google Reviews?\nStandards of Practice\nNaturopathic Doctors\nNo\nLink\nRegistered Massage Therapist\nPossibly\nLink\nChiropractor\nYes\nLink\nPhysiotherapist\nPossibly\nLink\nAcupuncture\nPossibly. Please refer to pages 48-50 of the bylaws, which indicate\n      practitioners need to watch the content of the reviews closely.\nLink\nCounsellor\nUnlikely, due to association requirements.

Here are some reasons why:\nThe patient’s appointment was not marked as\nArrived\n(this includes No Show, cancelled/deleted, and unarrived appointments as Jane won’t send a Ratings email for an appointment that did not occur)\nThe patient’s is arrived\nafter\nthe calendar date of the appointment. For example, if an appointment is booked for August 18th, but is not marked as arrived until  August 19th, then Jane will not send out a notification.\nThe patient has “Do Not Email” selected in their profile\nThe patient has opted out of Ratings emails in their My Account\nThe patient has no email address or an invalid email\nThe practitioner is not opted into the clinic’s Ratings and Reviews settings.\nCan I manually send a ratings email to a patient?\nNo\n, at the moment there isn’t a way to manually resend these emails to clients and are only automatically prompted after the appointment is marked as arrived.\nAdditional Resources\nIf you haven’t seen them already, we have a handful of ratings & reviews guides on several topics:\nHow to Setup Ratings & Reviews\nReview Your Ratings (for Practitioners)\nFilling out a Rating Survey (for Patients)\nSetting up your location for Google Reviews\nAs always, we love hearing from you!\nYou can reach out to us here\n.Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.\n500 - 138 13th Street East, North Vancouver\nBritish Columbia, Canada V7L 0E5\nContact Us\n+1 844-310-JANE (5263)\n+44 808 164 0893\n+61 1 800 940 893\n+1 604-670-JANE (5263)\nseejanerun@janeapp.com\nWant to keep up-to-date with everything that’s new in Jane?
