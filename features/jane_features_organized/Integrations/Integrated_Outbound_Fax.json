Check out\nthis section of the guide below for details\n.\nWelcome to our Integrated Outbound Fax guide. We’ve partnered with\nDocumo\n, a HIPAA, PIPEDA, and GDPR-compliant, cloud fax software so that you can send faxes directly from your patients’ charts. Currently, you can fax a single chart entry, multiple chart entries within a date range, or whole Treatment Plans from the patient profile along with a cover page.\nInbound faxing isn’t integrated into Jane, but you can receive inbound faxes directly to your Documo portal, so your entire fax history will live in one place.\nThe team is continuing to improve on this feature and would love to\nhear your feedback\n.\nThis integration is available for clinics in 🇨🇦 Canada and 🇺🇸 the US.\nSigning up for a Documo license\nConnecting Documo with Jane\nCreating a custom cover page template in Documo\nSending a fax\nUsing the address book\nViewing your fax history\nDisconnecting the Integration\nFAQ & Troubleshooting\nSigning up for a Documo license\nJane users can sign up for a Documo license from their Jane account for a\nspecial rate of $15 USD/month\n. This includes:\n500 fax pages per month + $0.08 per page for each additional page\nThis includes inbound faxes which you can receive through the Documo portal and outbound faxes which you can send directly through Jane.\n3 fax numbers + $3 a month for each additional number\nDocumo’s suite of\ninbound and outbound faxing features\nYou also have the option to bring over your existing fax number for a one-time fee of $15 USD.\nTo sign up for your Documo license, head to\nSettings\n>\nIntegrations\n>\nDocumo\n>\nGet Started\n:\nNext, click\nSign up for Documo\n:\nYou can choose a password for your Documo account and click\nContinue\n:\nNow you should see a confirmation page like the one below.\nYou’ll want to head to your email inbox to activate your account and click\nConfirm Email\n:\nOkay, you’re all set! Now you’ll connect your Documo account to Jane by following the steps in the next section of this guide.\nConnecting Documo with Jane\nOnce you’ve signed up for your Documo license, it’s time to link it to your Jane account. Start by signing into the\nDocumo portal\nand selecting\nAPI Keys\nand click\nCreate\n.\nEnter a name, set the access level, leave the expiration date blank, and click\nCreate\n.\nThis part’s important! You only have one chance to copy your API key. Click the\nCopy\nbutton next to your key and then click the green\nI saved it, close\nbutton.\nIf you close this window before copying your code, just click the red trash can next to the code and delete it, then repeat the steps above to create a new one.\nOnce you’ve copied your code, head back to Jane and click\nSettings\n>\nIntegrations\n>\nDocumo\n>\nGet Started\n:\nPaste the API Token into the Token field and click\nConnect\n:\nCreating a custom cover page template in Documo\nBefore you send your first fax, you can set your default cover page in Documo. The cover page template set as the Account Default within Documo will automatically be applied as the cover page for all documents.\nTo set the default, sign into the Documo portal and head to\nCover Pages\n. Once you find the template you’d like to use, click the three dots to open the menu and select\nSet as Account Default\n:\nSending a fax\nOnce you have successfully set up your Documo integration, you’re ready to send your first fax! 📠\nThere are three different ways to send a fax in Jane. You can either send a single chart, multiple charts within a date range, or all the charts within a Treatment Plan.\nFaxing a single chart\nStart by heading to your patient’s charting area and click the drop-down arrow to the right of the chart entry you want to send. Select\nFax\nfrom the dropdown menu.\nOnce you have selected the chart entry you’d like to fax, you’ll enter the Recipient Name and Fax Number, or select a contact from your address book.\nIf you haven’t done so already, enable Cover Page by flipping the toggle to blue. When sending a fax from Jane, you will also be able to add customized details into the\nSubject\nand\nNotes\nfields for each individual fax for any specific info you’d like to include, ensuring the cover page fits your needs every time.\n💡\nJane tip\n: if you’d like an inbound fax reply to go to a different fax number than the number you’re sending from, you can add that into the Notes section of the Cover Page ⤵️\nWhen you’re ready, scroll down and click\nSend\n.\nOnce the fax has been successfully sent, you should see a green Sent notification at the top of the page.\nYou’re doing great!\nFaxing multiple chart entries in a date range\nTo fax multiple chart entries, start in the patient charting tab and click\nFilter/Export\nfollowed by the Date Range you’d like to fax:\nNow click the\nthree dots\nto the right of the filter options and select\nFax\n.\nFaxing a Treatment Plan\nTo send a Treatment Plan, click\nActions\nnext to the Treatment Plan you’d like to send and select\nFax\n.\n📣 Just a heads up — Practitioner Limited users don’t have the required access level to send faxes.\nUsing the address book\nJane’s Address Book helps keep contact details organized, making it easier to send faxes\nwithout re-entering information each time. You can add and manage contacts in two ways — from the Settings tab, or while sending a fax.\nAdding a Contact from Settings\nTo add a contact before you send a fax, head to\nSettings > Address Book\n.\nClick\nNew Entry\nfrom the top right-hand side of the screen.\nSelect whether you’re adding a\nPerson\nor an\nOrganization\n. Fill in their details, including their\nname, email, phone number, fax number, and address and click\nCreate\n.\n💡\nJane tip\n— To be sure that the name displays fully on the fax cover sheet, keep the names short. The\nFirst Name, Last Name, and Organization\nfields combine into one, and anything over 40 characters will be cut off.\nAdding a Contact While Sending a Fax\nYou can also add a contact while you’re sending a fax. Start by heading to your\npatient’s\ncharting area\nand click the\ndrop-down arrow\nto the right of the chart entry you want to send.\nSelect\nFax\nfrom the dropdown menu.\nIn the recipient name field, hit the\nspace bar\nto bring up your existing contacts. To add a\nnew one, click\nAdd New Entry\n. Select\nPerson\nor\nOrganization\n, enter their details, and click\nCreate Contact\n.\nOnce you’ve added your contact, you can continue sending your fax to this client, and it will\nbe saved in your address book for future use.\nViewing your fax history\nIf you’d like to view your detailed fax history, you can log in to the Documo portal and click\nHistory\n.\n💡\nJane tip\n: The\nHistory\ntab is also where you can view inbound faxes.\nSelect the checkbox for the fax you’d like to see and click on\nView/Print\nto open the file:\nDisconnecting the Integration\nIf you would like to disconnect the integration at any point, head to\nSettings > Integrations > Documo > Disconnect\n:\nFAQ & Troubleshooting\nCan I receive inbound faxes?\nWill I receive a notification for inbound faxes?\nDo I need to create a user in Documo for each staff member using this integration?\nCan each user in Documo be linked to a staff profile in Jane?\nWhat number do outbound faxes in Jane get sent from?\nCan all users in Documo view outbound faxes?\nCan I send a fax to an international number?\nMy fax has an error code, what does it mean?\nWhat if I send & receive way more than the 500-page per month limit?\nDo inbound faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?\nAre outbound cover pages counted towards my 500-page per month limit?\nDo failed faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?\nHow can I track my page count to see if I’m close or over 500 pages?\nHow do I transfer over my existing fax number?\nCan I import my contacts to Documo?\nWill Jane use my contacts in Documo when sending a fax?\nCan I customize my cover sheet details based on patient and practitioner?\nCan each practitioner send a fax from their own fax number?\nCan I receive inbound faxes?\nYes, though you will only be able to view them in Documo, not in Jane. There are a few spots in Documo where you can view incoming faxes, but the main one is the\nHistory\npage. Notifications for inbound faxes can also be sent directly to a user’s email.\nAdditionally, you can download an incoming fax and upload it to a patient’s chart as needed.\nDo I need to create a user in Documo for each staff member using this integration?\nWe recommend creating separate Users in Documo for each staff member who will be logging into the Documo portal outside of Jane. That way, multiple people don’t share one Documo login.\nYou don’t need to log into the Documo portal to send a fax, only to view inbound faxes and your fax history (including a fax’s status).\nWill I receive a notification for inbound faxes?\nEach User in Documo can subscribe to the fax numbers they’d like to receive notifications for. When an inbound fax is sent to a number they’re subscribed to, they will receive an email notification.\nTo learn more about email notifications,\ncheck out Documo’s guide here\n.\nCan each user in Documo be linked to a staff profile in Jane?\nNo, only one User in Documo can be linked to Jane at a time. The User you link to Jane is the one whose API key you choose when connecting Documo to Jane.\nAll faxes sent from Jane, regardless of which practitioner sends them, will come from one User in Documo and the fax number chosen as the account default.\nWhat number do outbound faxes in Jane get sent from?\nWhichever number is set as the account default will be the one that all faxes come from, regardless of which staff profile in Jane sends a fax through the integration.\nYou can edit the number chosen as the account default in Documo by heading to\nFax > My Fax Numbers > Set Primary\n.\nCan all users in Documo view outbound faxes?\nSince all outbound faxes will come from the same default number, they will all show up in the fax history of the User profile in Documo that is connected to Jane.\nOther Users in Documo will not be able to view those outbound faxes unless their User Role in Documo is set to Admin or Owner.\nAn Admin can view all inbound and outbound faxes for all other users in Documo, and an Owner can view all faxes plus the Billing tab. To learn more about User permission levels in Documo,\ncheck out their guide\n.\nTo change a User’s role in Documo, head to Users and click the cogwheel next to their profile.\nFrom here, you can click the\nUser Role\ndrop-down and choose\nAdmin\n.\nDon’t forget to hit the\nSave\nbutton at the bottom of the page.\nCan I send a fax to an international number?\nYes, you can reach out to\njane@documo.com\nand request that international faxing be enabled for your account. Please note that\ndifferent rates apply\nfor sending international faxes.\nMy fax has an error code, what does it mean?\nDocumo has a great resource for\ncommon Fax Error Codes here\n.\nHere are some quick tips from Documo:\n6100 error code is a busy signal and also the most common error.\n8000’s error codes usually mean a connection failure from either the sender or recipient. Always try resending these faxes, and remember, failed faxes do not count towards your license limit of 500 pages per month.\n5000’s error codes refer to an issue with the document being faxed. You can reach out to Documo at support@documo.com for assistance.\nThe\nNet::HTTPForbidden\nerror means that your 14-day trial of Documo has ended. You can select a new plan by clicking the link in the reminder email you received from Documo, or by heading to the Billing tab in Documo and selecting the Jane plan.\nThe\nCaller ID is not allowed. Please use a Caller ID verified on this account\nerror will typically appear after changing or porting your existing number to Documo.  It’s possible you may have missed a step during the porting process to set your caller ID number on your account.  To select the correct caller ID number, you can login to your Documo account, then head to\nProfile Name → Your Settings → Fax → Fax Caller ID\ndropdown and select your desired number here.  You can find guide steps\nhere\non how to select it.\nWhat if I send & receive way more than the 500-page per month limit?\nIf you send and receive far more than 500 pages a month or require more than 3 fax numbers/users, please email\njane@documo.com\nto request a custom rate.\nDo inbound faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?\nYes, any pages that are successfully transmitted count toward your monthly total, including inbound pages.\nAre outbound cover pages counted towards my 500-page per month limit?\nYes, outbound cover pages are included in your 500-page monthly limit. Every successfully sent page, including cover pages, counts toward your total.\nDo failed faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?\nNo, only pages that are successfully transmitted count towards your monthly total.\nHow can I track my page count to see if I’m close or over 500 pages?\nThere isn’t a notification that lets you know when you’ve reached 500 pages a month, so you’ll want to keep an eye on this by heading to the\nReports\nsection in Documo and selecting the\nUsage Report\nto see where you’re at for the month.\nHow do I transfer over my existing fax number?\nYou can transfer over your existing fax number for a one-time fee of $15 USD. Submit a port request through the porting tab in Documo to get started. It can take between 7-10 business days for your request to be completed. Check out\nDocumo’s guide\nfor more details.\nIf you are currently signed up for Documo’s 2-week trial, we recommend you wait to transfer over your existing fax number until you have signed up for a paid plan to ensure there’s no interruption for inbound faxes.\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding the porting process feel free to reach out to the Documo team via email at\nporting@documo.com\nor via live chat in the Documo app.\nCan I import my contacts to Documo?\nDocumo has an address book that you can import contacts to by uploading a CSV file. Check out\nDocumo’s guide here for details\n.\nWill Jane use my contacts in Documo when sending a fax?\nNo, Jane doesn’t pull your contacts from Documo. However, if you’ve faxed a contact recently, Jane will auto-complete their information when you begin typing their name into the\nRecipient Name\nfield.\nCan I customize my cover sheet details based on patient and practitioner?\nThe cover page template set as the Account Default in Documo will automatically be used for all faxes, but you can change it anytime in the Documo portal.\nWhen sending a fax from Jane, you can also add customized details into the\nSubject\nand\nNotes\nfields for each individual fax for any specific info you’d like to include, ensuring the cover page fits your needs every time.\nCan each practitioner send a fax from their own fax number?\nThe Documo plan for Jane customers includes 3 fax numbers, but only one can be set as the default at a time. The default number is the one faxes in Jane will be sent from, and the one that replies will be sent to.\n💡\nJane tip\n: if you’d like an inbound fax to go to a different fax number than the number you’re sending from, you can add that into the Notes section of the Cover Page when sending a fax.\nYou can set your default number in Documo via\nFax > My Fax Numbers > Set Primary\n. You cannot easily switch between numbers from within Jane at this time.\nIf you have any questions please don’t hesitate to\nget in touch\nwith our lovely team.

Check out\nthis section of the guide below for details\n.\nWelcome to our Integrated Outbound Fax guide. We’ve partnered with\nDocumo\n, a HIPAA, PIPEDA, and GDPR-compliant, cloud fax software so that you can send faxes directly from your patients’ charts. Currently, you can fax a single chart entry, multiple chart entries within a date range, or whole Treatment Plans from the patient profile along with a cover page.\nInbound faxing isn’t integrated into Jane, but you can receive inbound faxes directly to your Documo portal, so your entire fax history will live in one place.\nThe team is continuing to improve on this feature and would love to\nhear your feedback\n.\nThis integration is available for clinics in 🇨🇦 Canada and 🇺🇸 the US.\nSigning up for a Documo license\nConnecting Documo with Jane\nCreating a custom cover page template in Documo\nSending a fax\nUsing the address book\nViewing your fax history\nDisconnecting the Integration\nFAQ & Troubleshooting\nSigning up for a Documo license\nJane users can sign up for a Documo license from their Jane account for a\nspecial rate of $15 USD/month\n. This includes:\n500 fax pages per month + $0.08 per page for each additional page\nThis includes inbound faxes which you can receive through the Documo portal and outbound faxes which you can send directly through Jane.\n3 fax numbers + $3 a month for each additional number\nDocumo’s suite of\ninbound and outbound faxing features\nYou also have the option to bring over your existing fax number for a one-time fee of $15 USD.\nTo sign up for your Documo license, head to\nSettings\n>\nIntegrations\n>\nDocumo\n>\nGet Started\n:\nNext, click\nSign up for Documo\n:\nYou can choose a password for your Documo account and click\nContinue\n:\nNow you should see a confirmation page like the one below.\nYou’ll want to head to your email inbox to activate your account and click\nConfirm Email\n:\nOkay, you’re all set! Now you’ll connect your Documo account to Jane by following the steps in the next section of this guide.\nConnecting Documo with Jane\nOnce you’ve signed up for your Documo license, it’s time to link it to your Jane account. Start by signing into the\nDocumo portal\nand selecting\nAPI Keys\nand click\nCreate\n.\nEnter a name, set the access level, leave the expiration date blank, and click\nCreate\n.\nThis part’s important! You only have one chance to copy your API key. Click the\nCopy\nbutton next to your key and then click the green\nI saved it, close\nbutton.\nIf you close this window before copying your code, just click the red trash can next to the code and delete it, then repeat the steps above to create a new one.\nOnce you’ve copied your code, head back to Jane and click\nSettings\n>\nIntegrations\n>\nDocumo\n>\nGet Started\n:\nPaste the API Token into the Token field and click\nConnect\n:\nCreating a custom cover page template in Documo\nBefore you send your first fax, you can set your default cover page in Documo. The cover page template set as the Account Default within Documo will automatically be applied as the cover page for all documents.\nTo set the default, sign into the Documo portal and head to\nCover Pages\n. Once you find the template you’d like to use, click the three dots to open the menu and select\nSet as Account Default\n:\nSending a fax\nOnce you have successfully set up your Documo integration, you’re ready to send your first fax! 📠\nThere are three different ways to send a fax in Jane. You can either send a single chart, multiple charts within a date range, or all the charts within a Treatment Plan.\nFaxing a single chart\nStart by heading to your patient’s charting area and click the drop-down arrow to the right of the chart entry you want to send. Select\nFax\nfrom the dropdown menu.\nOnce you have selected the chart entry you’d like to fax, you’ll enter the Recipient Name and Fax Number, or select a contact from your address book.\nIf you haven’t done so already, enable Cover Page by flipping the toggle to blue. When sending a fax from Jane, you will also be able to add customized details into the\nSubject\nand\nNotes\nfields for each individual fax for any specific info you’d like to include, ensuring the cover page fits your needs every time.\n💡\nJane tip\n: if you’d like an inbound fax reply to go to a different fax number than the number you’re sending from, you can add that into the Notes section of the Cover Page ⤵️\nWhen you’re ready, scroll down and click\nSend\n.\nOnce the fax has been successfully sent, you should see a green Sent notification at the top of the page.\nYou’re doing great!\nFaxing multiple chart entries in a date range\nTo fax multiple chart entries, start in the patient charting tab and click\nFilter/Export\nfollowed by the Date Range you’d like to fax:\nNow click the\nthree dots\nto the right of the filter options and select\nFax\n.\nFaxing a Treatment Plan\nTo send a Treatment Plan, click\nActions\nnext to the Treatment Plan you’d like to send and select\nFax\n.\n📣 Just a heads up — Practitioner Limited users don’t have the required access level to send faxes.\nUsing the address book\nJane’s Address Book helps keep contact details organized, making it easier to send faxes\nwithout re-entering information each time. You can add and manage contacts in two ways — from the Settings tab, or while sending a fax.\nAdding a Contact from Settings\nTo add a contact before you send a fax, head to\nSettings > Address Book\n.\nClick\nNew Entry\nfrom the top right-hand side of the screen.\nSelect whether you’re adding a\nPerson\nor an\nOrganization\n. Fill in their details, including their\nname, email, phone number, fax number, and address and click\nCreate\n.\n💡\nJane tip\n— To be sure that the name displays fully on the fax cover sheet, keep the names short. The\nFirst Name, Last Name, and Organization\nfields combine into one, and anything over 40 characters will be cut off.\nAdding a Contact While Sending a Fax\nYou can also add a contact while you’re sending a fax. Start by heading to your\npatient’s\ncharting area\nand click the\ndrop-down arrow\nto the right of the chart entry you want to send.\nSelect\nFax\nfrom the dropdown menu.\nIn the recipient name field, hit the\nspace bar\nto bring up your existing contacts. To add a\nnew one, click\nAdd New Entry\n. Select\nPerson\nor\nOrganization\n, enter their details, and click\nCreate Contact\n.\nOnce you’ve added your contact, you can continue sending your fax to this client, and it will\nbe saved in your address book for future use.\nViewing your fax history\nIf you’d like to view your detailed fax history, you can log in to the Documo portal and click\nHistory\n.\n💡\nJane tip\n: The\nHistory\ntab is also where you can view inbound faxes.\nSelect the checkbox for the fax you’d like to see and click on\nView/Print\nto open the file:\nDisconnecting the Integration\nIf you would like to disconnect the integration at any point, head to\nSettings > Integrations > Documo > Disconnect\n:\nFAQ & Troubleshooting\nCan I receive inbound faxes?\nWill I receive a notification for inbound faxes?\nDo I need to create a user in Documo for each staff member using this integration?\nCan each user in Documo be linked to a staff profile in Jane?\nWhat number do outbound faxes in Jane get sent from?\nCan all users in Documo view outbound faxes?\nCan I send a fax to an international number?\nMy fax has an error code, what does it mean?\nWhat if I send & receive way more than the 500-page per month limit?\nDo inbound faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?\nAre outbound cover pages counted towards my 500-page per month limit?\nDo failed faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?\nHow can I track my page count to see if I’m close or over 500 pages?\nHow do I transfer over my existing fax number?\nCan I import my contacts to Documo?\nWill Jane use my contacts in Documo when sending a fax?\nCan I customize my cover sheet details based on patient and practitioner?\nCan each practitioner send a fax from their own fax number?\nCan I receive inbound faxes?\nYes, though you will only be able to view them in Documo, not in Jane. There are a few spots in Documo where you can view incoming faxes, but the main one is the\nHistory\npage. Notifications for inbound faxes can also be sent directly to a user’s email.\nAdditionally, you can download an incoming fax and upload it to a patient’s chart as needed.\nDo I need to create a user in Documo for each staff member using this integration?\nWe recommend creating separate Users in Documo for each staff member who will be logging into the Documo portal outside of Jane. That way, multiple people don’t share one Documo login.\nYou don’t need to log into the Documo portal to send a fax, only to view inbound faxes and your fax history (including a fax’s status).\nWill I receive a notification for inbound faxes?\nEach User in Documo can subscribe to the fax numbers they’d like to receive notifications for. When an inbound fax is sent to a number they’re subscribed to, they will receive an email notification.\nTo learn more about email notifications,\ncheck out Documo’s guide here\n.\nCan each user in Documo be linked to a staff profile in Jane?\nNo, only one User in Documo can be linked to Jane at a time. The User you link to Jane is the one whose API key you choose when connecting Documo to Jane.\nAll faxes sent from Jane, regardless of which practitioner sends them, will come from one User in Documo and the fax number chosen as the account default.\nWhat number do outbound faxes in Jane get sent from?\nWhichever number is set as the account default will be the one that all faxes come from, regardless of which staff profile in Jane sends a fax through the integration.\nYou can edit the number chosen as the account default in Documo by heading to\nFax > My Fax Numbers > Set Primary\n.\nCan all users in Documo view outbound faxes?\nSince all outbound faxes will come from the same default number, they will all show up in the fax history of the User profile in Documo that is connected to Jane.\nOther Users in Documo will not be able to view those outbound faxes unless their User Role in Documo is set to Admin or Owner.\nAn Admin can view all inbound and outbound faxes for all other users in Documo, and an Owner can view all faxes plus the Billing tab. To learn more about User permission levels in Documo,\ncheck out their guide\n.\nTo change a User’s role in Documo, head to Users and click the cogwheel next to their profile.\nFrom here, you can click the\nUser Role\ndrop-down and choose\nAdmin\n.\nDon’t forget to hit the\nSave\nbutton at the bottom of the page.\nCan I send a fax to an international number?\nYes, you can reach out to\njane@documo.com\nand request that international faxing be enabled for your account. Please note that\ndifferent rates apply\nfor sending international faxes.\nMy fax has an error code, what does it mean?\nDocumo has a great resource for\ncommon Fax Error Codes here\n.\nHere are some quick tips from Documo:\n6100 error code is a busy signal and also the most common error.\n8000’s error codes usually mean a connection failure from either the sender or recipient. Always try resending these faxes, and remember, failed faxes do not count towards your license limit of 500 pages per month.\n5000’s error codes refer to an issue with the document being faxed. You can reach out to Documo at support@documo.com for assistance.\nThe\nNet::HTTPForbidden\nerror means that your 14-day trial of Documo has ended. You can select a new plan by clicking the link in the reminder email you received from Documo, or by heading to the Billing tab in Documo and selecting the Jane plan.\nThe\nCaller ID is not allowed. Please use a Caller ID verified on this account\nerror will typically appear after changing or porting your existing number to Documo.  It’s possible you may have missed a step during the porting process to set your caller ID number on your account.  To select the correct caller ID number, you can login to your Documo account, then head to\nProfile Name → Your Settings → Fax → Fax Caller ID\ndropdown and select your desired number here.  You can find guide steps\nhere\non how to select it.\nWhat if I send & receive way more than the 500-page per month limit?\nIf you send and receive far more than 500 pages a month or require more than 3 fax numbers/users, please email\njane@documo.com\nto request a custom rate.\nDo inbound faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?\nYes, any pages that are successfully transmitted count toward your monthly total, including inbound pages.\nAre outbound cover pages counted towards my 500-page per month limit?\nYes, outbound cover pages are included in your 500-page monthly limit. Every successfully sent page, including cover pages, counts toward your total.\nDo failed faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?\nNo, only pages that are successfully transmitted count towards your monthly total.\nHow can I track my page count to see if I’m close or over 500 pages?\nThere isn’t a notification that lets you know when you’ve reached 500 pages a month, so you’ll want to keep an eye on this by heading to the\nReports\nsection in Documo and selecting the\nUsage Report\nto see where you’re at for the month.\nHow do I transfer over my existing fax number?\nYou can transfer over your existing fax number for a one-time fee of $15 USD. Submit a port request through the porting tab in Documo to get started. It can take between 7-10 business days for your request to be completed. Check out\nDocumo’s guide\nfor more details.\nIf you are currently signed up for Documo’s 2-week trial, we recommend you wait to transfer over your existing fax number until you have signed up for a paid plan to ensure there’s no interruption for inbound faxes.\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding the porting process feel free to reach out to the Documo team via email at\nporting@documo.com\nor via live chat in the Documo app.\nCan I import my contacts to Documo?\nDocumo has an address book that you can import contacts to by uploading a CSV file. Check out\nDocumo’s guide here for details\n.\nWill Jane use my contacts in Documo when sending a fax?\nNo, Jane doesn’t pull your contacts from Documo. However, if you’ve faxed a contact recently, Jane will auto-complete their information when you begin typing their name into the\nRecipient Name\nfield.\nCan I customize my cover sheet details based on patient and practitioner?\nThe cover page template set as the Account Default in Documo will automatically be used for all faxes, but you can change it anytime in the Documo portal.\nWhen sending a fax from Jane, you can also add customized details into the\nSubject\nand\nNotes\nfields for each individual fax for any specific info you’d like to include, ensuring the cover page fits your needs every time.\nCan each practitioner send a fax from their own fax number?\nThe Documo plan for Jane customers includes 3 fax numbers, but only one can be set as the default at a time. The default number is the one faxes in Jane will be sent from, and the one that replies will be sent to.\n💡\nJane tip\n: if you’d like an inbound fax to go to a different fax number than the number you’re sending from, you can add that into the Notes section of the Cover Page when sending a fax.\nYou can set your default number in Documo via\nFax > My Fax Numbers > Set Primary\n. You cannot easily switch between numbers from within Jane at this time.\nIf you have any questions please don’t hesitate to\nget in touch\nwith our lovely team.
