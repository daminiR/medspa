Integrated Outbound Fax

📣
Head’s up!
Since recording this video, the steps to copy your API Key have changed slightly. Check out
this section of the guide below for details
.
Welcome to our Integrated Outbound Fax guide. We’ve partnered with
Documo
, a HIPAA, PIPEDA, and GDPR-compliant, cloud fax software so that you can send faxes directly from your patients’ charts. Currently, you can fax a single chart entry, multiple chart entries within a date range, or whole Treatment Plans from the patient profile along with a cover page.
Inbound faxing isn’t integrated into Jane, but you can receive inbound faxes directly to your Documo portal, so your entire fax history will live in one place.
The team is continuing to improve on this feature and would love to
hear your feedback
.
This integration is available for clinics in 🇨🇦 Canada and 🇺🇸 the US.

Signing up for a Documo license
Jane users can sign up for a Documo license from their Jane account for a
special rate of $15 USD/month
. This includes:
500 fax pages per month + $0.08 per page for each additional page
This includes inbound faxes which you can receive through the Documo portal and outbound faxes which you can send directly through Jane.
3 fax numbers + $3 a month for each additional number
Documo’s suite of
inbound and outbound faxing features
You also have the option to bring over your existing fax number for a one-time fee of $15 USD.

Documo portal
and selecting
API Keys
and click
Create
.
Enter a name, set the access level, leave the expiration date blank, and click

Creating a custom cover page template in Documo
Before you send your first fax, you can set your default cover page in Documo. The cover page template set as the Account Default within Documo will automatically be applied as the cover page for all documents.
To set the default, sign into the Documo portal and head to
Cover Pages
. Once you find the template you’d like to use, click the three dots to open the menu and select
Set as Account Default
:
Sending a fax
Once you have successfully set up your Documo integration, you’re ready to send your first fax! 📠
There are three different ways to send a fax in Jane. You can either send a single chart, multiple charts within a date range, or all the charts within a Treatment Plan.
Faxing a single chart
Start by heading to your patient’s charting area and click the drop-down arrow to the right of the chart entry you want to send. Select
Fax
from the dropdown menu.
Once you have selected the chart entry you’d like to fax, you’ll enter the Recipient Name and Fax Number, or select a contact from your address book.
If you haven’t done so already, enable Cover Page by flipping the toggle to blue. When sending a fax from Jane, you will also be able to add customized details into the
Subject
and
Notes
fields for each individual fax for any specific info you’d like to include, ensuring the cover page fits your needs every time.
💡
Jane tip
: if you’d like an inbound fax reply to go to a different fax number than the number you’re sending from, you can add that into the Notes section of the Cover Page ⤵️
When you’re ready, scroll down and click
Send
.
Once the fax has been successfully sent, you should see a green Sent notification at the top of the page.
You’re doing great!
Faxing multiple chart entries in a date range
To fax multiple chart entries, start in the patient charting tab and click
Filter/Export
followed by the Date Range you’d like to fax:
Now click the
three dots
to the right of the filter options and select
Fax
.
Faxing a Treatment Plan
To send a Treatment Plan, click
Actions
next to the Treatment Plan you’d like to send and select
Fax
.
📣 Just a heads up — Practitioner Limited users don’t have the required access level to send faxes.
Using the address book
Jane’s Address Book helps keep contact details organized, making it easier to send faxes
without re-entering information each time. You can add and manage contacts in two ways — from the Settings tab, or while sending a fax.
Adding a Contact from Settings
To add a contact before you send a fax, head to
Settings > Address Book
.
Click
New Entry
from the top right-hand side of the screen.
Select whether you’re adding a
Person
or an
Organization
. Fill in their details, including their
name, email, phone number, fax number, and address and click
Create
.
💡
Jane tip
— To be sure that the name displays fully on the fax cover sheet, keep the names short. The
First Name, Last Name, and Organization
fields combine into one, and anything over 40 characters will be cut off.
Adding a Contact While Sending a Fax
You can also add a contact while you’re sending a fax. Start by heading to your
patient’s
charting area
and click the
drop-down arrow
to the right of the chart entry you want to send.
Select
Fax
from the dropdown menu.
In the recipient name field, hit the
space bar
to bring up your existing contacts. To add a
new one, click
Add New Entry
. Select
Person
or
Organization
, enter their details, and click
Create Contact
.
Once you’ve added your contact, you can continue sending your fax to this client, and it will
be saved in your address book for future use.
Viewing your fax history
If you’d like to view your detailed fax history, you can log in to the Documo portal and click
History
.
💡
Jane tip
: The
History
tab is also where you can view inbound faxes.
Select the checkbox for the fax you’d like to see and click on
View/Print
to open the file:

FAQ & Troubleshooting
Can I receive inbound faxes?
Will I receive a notification for inbound faxes?
Do I need to create a user in Documo for each staff member using this integration?
Can each user in Documo be linked to a staff profile in Jane?
What number do outbound faxes in Jane get sent from?
Can all users in Documo view outbound faxes?
Can I send a fax to an international number?
My fax has an error code, what does it mean?
What if I send & receive way more than the 500-page per month limit?
Do inbound faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?
Are outbound cover pages counted towards my 500-page per month limit?
Do failed faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?
How can I track my page count to see if I’m close or over 500 pages?
How do I transfer over my existing fax number?
Can I import my contacts to Documo?
Will Jane use my contacts in Documo when sending a fax?
Can I customize my cover sheet details based on patient and practitioner?
Can each practitioner send a fax from their own fax number?
Can I receive inbound faxes?
Yes, though you will only be able to view them in Documo, not in Jane. There are a few spots in Documo where you can view incoming faxes, but the main one is the
History
page. Notifications for inbound faxes can also be sent directly to a user’s email.
Additionally, you can download an incoming fax and upload it to a patient’s chart as needed.
Do I need to create a user in Documo for each staff member using this integration?
We recommend creating separate Users in Documo for each staff member who will be logging into the Documo portal outside of Jane. That way, multiple people don’t share one Documo login.
You don’t need to log into the Documo portal to send a fax, only to view inbound faxes and your fax history (including a fax’s status).
Will I receive a notification for inbound faxes?
Each User in Documo can subscribe to the fax numbers they’d like to receive notifications for. When an inbound fax is sent to a number they’re subscribed to, they will receive an email notification.
To learn more about email notifications,
check out Documo’s guide here
.
Can each user in Documo be linked to a staff profile in Jane?
No, only one User in Documo can be linked to Jane at a time. The User you link to Jane is the one whose API key you choose when connecting Documo to Jane.
All faxes sent from Jane, regardless of which practitioner sends them, will come from one User in Documo and the fax number chosen as the account default.
What number do outbound faxes in Jane get sent from?
Whichever number is set as the account default will be the one that all faxes come from, regardless of which staff profile in Jane sends a fax through the integration.
You can edit the number chosen as the account default in Documo by heading to
Fax > My Fax Numbers > Set Primary
.
Can all users in Documo view outbound faxes?
Since all outbound faxes will come from the same default number, they will all show up in the fax history of the User profile in Documo that is connected to Jane.
Other Users in Documo will not be able to view those outbound faxes unless their User Role in Documo is set to Admin or Owner.
An Admin can view all inbound and outbound faxes for all other users in Documo, and an Owner can view all faxes plus the Billing tab. To learn more about User permission levels in Documo,
check out their guide
.
To change a User’s role in Documo, head to Users and click the cogwheel next to their profile.
From here, you can click the
User Role
drop-down and choose
Admin
.
Don’t forget to hit the
Save
button at the bottom of the page.
Can I send a fax to an international number?
Yes, you can reach out to
jane@documo.com
and request that international faxing be enabled for your account. Please note that
different rates apply
for sending international faxes.
My fax has an error code, what does it mean?
Documo has a great resource for
common Fax Error Codes here
.
Here are some quick tips from Documo:
6100 error code is a busy signal and also the most common error.
8000’s error codes usually mean a connection failure from either the sender or recipient. Always try resending these faxes, and remember, failed faxes do not count towards your license limit of 500 pages per month.
5000’s error codes refer to an issue with the document being faxed. You can reach out to Documo at support@documo.com for assistance.
The
Net::HTTPForbidden
error means that your 14-day trial of Documo has ended. You can select a new plan by clicking the link in the reminder email you received from Documo, or by heading to the Billing tab in Documo and selecting the Jane plan.
The
Caller ID is not allowed. Please use a Caller ID verified on this account
error will typically appear after changing or porting your existing number to Documo.  It’s possible you may have missed a step during the porting process to set your caller ID number on your account.  To select the correct caller ID number, you can login to your Documo account, then head to
Profile Name → Your Settings → Fax → Fax Caller ID
dropdown and select your desired number here.  You can find guide steps
here
on how to select it.
What if I send & receive way more than the 500-page per month limit?
If you send and receive far more than 500 pages a month or require more than 3 fax numbers/users, please email
jane@documo.com
to request a custom rate.
Do inbound faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?
Yes, any pages that are successfully transmitted count toward your monthly total, including inbound pages.
Are outbound cover pages counted towards my 500-page per month limit?
Yes, outbound cover pages are included in your 500-page monthly limit. Every successfully sent page, including cover pages, counts toward your total.
Do failed faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?
No, only pages that are successfully transmitted count towards your monthly total.
How can I track my page count to see if I’m close or over 500 pages?
There isn’t a notification that lets you know when you’ve reached 500 pages a month, so you’ll want to keep an eye on this by heading to the
Reports
section in Documo and selecting the
Usage Report
to see where you’re at for the month.
How do I transfer over my existing fax number?
You can transfer over your existing fax number for a one-time fee of $15 USD. Submit a port request through the porting tab in Documo to get started. It can take between 7-10 business days for your request to be completed. Check out
Documo’s guide
for more details.
If you are currently signed up for Documo’s 2-week trial, we recommend you wait to transfer over your existing fax number until you have signed up for a paid plan to ensure there’s no interruption for inbound faxes.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding the porting process feel free to reach out to the Documo team via email at
porting@documo.com
or via live chat in the Documo app.
Can I import my contacts to Documo?
Documo has an address book that you can import contacts to by uploading a CSV file. Check out
Documo’s guide here for details
.
Will Jane use my contacts in Documo when sending a fax?
No, Jane doesn’t pull your contacts from Documo. However, if you’ve faxed a contact recently, Jane will auto-complete their information when you begin typing their name into the
Recipient Name
field.
Can I customize my cover sheet details based on patient and practitioner?
The cover page template set as the Account Default in Documo will automatically be used for all faxes, but you can change it anytime in the Documo portal.
When sending a fax from Jane, you can also add customized details into the
Subject
and
Notes
fields for each individual fax for any specific info you’d like to include, ensuring the cover page fits your needs every time.
Can each practitioner send a fax from their own fax number?
The Documo plan for Jane customers includes 3 fax numbers, but only one can be set as the default at a time. The default number is the one faxes in Jane will be sent from, and the one that replies will be sent to.
💡
Jane tip
: if you’d like an inbound fax to go to a different fax number than the number you’re sending from, you can add that into the Notes section of the Cover Page when sending a fax.
You can set your default number in Documo via
Fax > My Fax Numbers > Set Primary
. You cannot easily switch between numbers from within Jane at this time.
If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to
get in touch
with our lovely team. Happy faxing 🎉

Integrated Outbound Fax
19 min read📣
Head’s up!
Since recording this video, the steps to copy your API Key have changed slightly. Check out
this section of the guide below for details
.
Welcome to our Integrated Outbound Fax guide. We’ve partnered with
Documo
, a HIPAA, PIPEDA, and GDPR-compliant, cloud fax software so that you can send faxes directly from your patients’ charts. Currently, you can fax a single chart entry, multiple chart entries within a date range, or whole Treatment Plans from the patient profile along with a cover page.
Inbound faxing isn’t integrated into Jane, but you can receive inbound faxes directly to your Documo portal, so your entire fax history will live in one place.
The team is continuing to improve on this feature and would love to
hear your feedback
.
This integration is available for clinics in 🇨🇦 Canada and 🇺🇸 the US.

Signing up for a Documo license
Jane users can sign up for a Documo license from their Jane account for a
special rate of $15 USD/month
. This includes:
500 fax pages per month + $0.08 per page for each additional page
This includes inbound faxes which you can receive through the Documo portal and outbound faxes which you can send directly through Jane.
3 fax numbers + $3 a month for each additional number
Documo’s suite of
inbound and outbound faxing features
You also have the option to bring over your existing fax number for a one-time fee of $15 USD.
To sign up for your Documo license, head to

Documo portal
and selecting

Enter a name, set the access level, leave the expiration date blank, and click

Creating a custom cover page template in Documo
Before you send your first fax, you can set your default cover page in Documo. The cover page template set as the Account Default within Documo will automatically be applied as the cover page for all documents.
To set the default, sign into the Documo portal and head to
Cover Pages
. Once you find the template you’d like to use, click the three dots to open the menu and select
Set as Account Default
:
Sending a fax
Once you have successfully set up your Documo integration, you’re ready to send your first fax! 📠
There are three different ways to send a fax in Jane. You can either send a single chart, multiple charts within a date range, or all the charts within a Treatment Plan.
Faxing a single chart
Start by heading to your patient’s charting area and click the drop-down arrow to the right of the chart entry you want to send. Select
Fax
from the dropdown menu.
Once you have selected the chart entry you’d like to fax, you’ll enter the Recipient Name and Fax Number, or select a contact from your address book.
If you haven’t done so already, enable Cover Page by flipping the toggle to blue. When sending a fax from Jane, you will also be able to add customized details into the
Subject
and
Notes
fields for each individual fax for any specific info you’d like to include, ensuring the cover page fits your needs every time.
💡
Jane tip
: if you’d like an inbound fax reply to go to a different fax number than the number you’re sending from, you can add that into the Notes section of the Cover Page ⤵️
When you’re ready, scroll down and click
Send
.
Once the fax has been successfully sent, you should see a green Sent notification at the top of the page.
You’re doing great!
Faxing multiple chart entries in a date range
To fax multiple chart entries, start in the patient charting tab and click
Filter/Export
followed by the Date Range you’d like to fax:
Now click the
three dots
to the right of the filter options and select
Fax
.
Faxing a Treatment Plan
To send a Treatment Plan, click
Actions
next to the Treatment Plan you’d like to send and select
Fax
.
📣 Just a heads up — Practitioner Limited users don’t have the required access level to send faxes.
Using the address book
Jane’s Address Book helps keep contact details organized, making it easier to send faxes
without re-entering information each time. You can add and manage contacts in two ways — from the Settings tab, or while sending a fax.
Adding a Contact from Settings
To add a contact before you send a fax, head to
Settings > Address Book
.
Click
New Entry
from the top right-hand side of the screen.
Select whether you’re adding a
Person
or an
Organization
. Fill in their details, including their
name, email, phone number, fax number, and address and click
Create
.
💡
Jane tip
— To be sure that the name displays fully on the fax cover sheet, keep the names short. The
First Name, Last Name, and Organization
fields combine into one, and anything over 40 characters will be cut off.
Adding a Contact While Sending a Fax
You can also add a contact while you’re sending a fax. Start by heading to your
patient’s
charting area
and click the
drop-down arrow
to the right of the chart entry you want to send.
Select
Fax
from the dropdown menu.
In the recipient name field, hit the
space bar
to bring up your existing contacts. To add a
new one, click
Add New Entry
. Select
Person
or
Organization
, enter their details, and click
Create Contact
.
Once you’ve added your contact, you can continue sending your fax to this client, and it will
be saved in your address book for future use.
Viewing your fax history
If you’d like to view your detailed fax history, you can log in to the Documo portal and click
History
.
💡
Jane tip
: The
History
tab is also where you can view inbound faxes.
Select the checkbox for the fax you’d like to see and click on
View/Print
to open the file:

FAQ & Troubleshooting
Can I receive inbound faxes?
Will I receive a notification for inbound faxes?
Do I need to create a user in Documo for each staff member using this integration?
Can each user in Documo be linked to a staff profile in Jane?
What number do outbound faxes in Jane get sent from?
Can all users in Documo view outbound faxes?
Can I send a fax to an international number?
My fax has an error code, what does it mean?
What if I send & receive way more than the 500-page per month limit?
Do inbound faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?
Are outbound cover pages counted towards my 500-page per month limit?
Do failed faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?
How can I track my page count to see if I’m close or over 500 pages?
How do I transfer over my existing fax number?
Can I import my contacts to Documo?
Will Jane use my contacts in Documo when sending a fax?
Can I customize my cover sheet details based on patient and practitioner?
Can each practitioner send a fax from their own fax number?
Can I receive inbound faxes?
Yes, though you will only be able to view them in Documo, not in Jane. There are a few spots in Documo where you can view incoming faxes, but the main one is the
History
page. Notifications for inbound faxes can also be sent directly to a user’s email.
Additionally, you can download an incoming fax and upload it to a patient’s chart as needed.
Do I need to create a user in Documo for each staff member using this integration?
We recommend creating separate Users in Documo for each staff member who will be logging into the Documo portal outside of Jane. That way, multiple people don’t share one Documo login.
You don’t need to log into the Documo portal to send a fax, only to view inbound faxes and your fax history (including a fax’s status).
Will I receive a notification for inbound faxes?
Each User in Documo can subscribe to the fax numbers they’d like to receive notifications for. When an inbound fax is sent to a number they’re subscribed to, they will receive an email notification.
To learn more about email notifications,
check out Documo’s guide here

No, only one User in Documo can be linked to Jane at a time. The User you link to Jane is the one whose API key you choose when connecting Documo to Jane.
All faxes sent from Jane, regardless of which practitioner sends them, will come from one User in Documo and the fax number chosen as the account default.
What number do outbound faxes in Jane get sent from?
Whichever number is set as the account default will be the one that all faxes come from, regardless of which staff profile in Jane sends a fax through the integration.
You can edit the number chosen as the account default in Documo by heading to
Fax > My Fax Numbers > Set Primary
.
Can all users in Documo view outbound faxes?
Since all outbound faxes will come from the same default number, they will all show up in the fax history of the User profile in Documo that is connected to Jane.
Other Users in Documo will not be able to view those outbound faxes unless their User Role in Documo is set to Admin or Owner.
An Admin can view all inbound and outbound faxes for all other users in Documo, and an Owner can view all faxes plus the Billing tab. To learn more about User permission levels in Documo,
check out their guide
.
To change a User’s role in Documo, head to Users and click the cogwheel next to their profile.
From here, you can click the
User Role
drop-down and choose
Admin
.
Don’t forget to hit the
Save
button at the bottom of the page.
Can I send a fax to an international number?
Yes, you can reach out to
jane@documo.com
and request that international faxing be enabled for your account. Please note that
different rates apply
for sending international faxes.
My fax has an error code, what does it mean?
Documo has a great resource for
common Fax Error Codes here
.
Here are some quick tips from Documo:
6100 error code is a busy signal and also the most common error.
8000’s error codes usually mean a connection failure from either the sender or recipient. Always try resending these faxes, and remember, failed faxes do not count towards your license limit of 500 pages per month.
5000’s error codes refer to an issue with the document being faxed. You can reach out to Documo at support@documo.com for assistance.
The
Net::HTTPForbidden
error means that your 14-day trial of Documo has ended. You can select a new plan by clicking the link in the reminder email you received from Documo, or by heading to the Billing tab in Documo and selecting the Jane plan.
The
Caller ID is not allowed. Please use a Caller ID verified on this account
error will typically appear after changing or porting your existing number to Documo.  It’s possible you may have missed a step during the porting process to set your caller ID number on your account.  To select the correct caller ID number, you can login to your Documo account, then head to
Profile Name → Your Settings → Fax → Fax Caller ID
dropdown and select your desired number here.  You can find guide steps
here
on how to select it.
What if I send & receive way more than the 500-page per month limit?
If you send and receive far more than 500 pages a month or require more than 3 fax numbers/users, please email
jane@documo.com
to request a custom rate.
Do inbound faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?
Yes, any pages that are successfully transmitted count toward your monthly total, including inbound pages.
Are outbound cover pages counted towards my 500-page per month limit?
Yes, outbound cover pages are included in your 500-page monthly limit. Every successfully sent page, including cover pages, counts toward your total.
Do failed faxes count towards my 500-page per month limit?
No, only pages that are successfully transmitted count towards your monthly total.
How can I track my page count to see if I’m close or over 500 pages?
There isn’t a notification that lets you know when you’ve reached 500 pages a month, so you’ll want to keep an eye on this by heading to the
Reports
section in Documo and selecting the
Usage Report
to see where you’re at for the month.
How do I transfer over my existing fax number?
You can transfer over your existing fax number for a one-time fee of $15 USD. Submit a port request through the porting tab in Documo to get started. It can take between 7-10 business days for your request to be completed. Check out
Documo’s guide
for more details.
If you are currently signed up for Documo’s 2-week trial, we recommend you wait to transfer over your existing fax number until you have signed up for a paid plan to ensure there’s no interruption for inbound faxes.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding the porting process feel free to reach out to the Documo team via email at
porting@documo.com
or via live chat in the Documo app.
Can I import my contacts to Documo?
Documo has an address book that you can import contacts to by uploading a CSV file. Check out
Documo’s guide here for details
.
Will Jane use my contacts in Documo when sending a fax?
No, Jane doesn’t pull your contacts from Documo. However, if you’ve faxed a contact recently, Jane will auto-complete their information when you begin typing their name into the
Recipient Name
field.
Can I customize my cover sheet details based on patient and practitioner?
The cover page template set as the Account Default in Documo will automatically be used for all faxes, but you can change it anytime in the Documo portal.
When sending a fax from Jane, you can also add customized details into the
Subject
and
Notes
fields for each individual fax for any specific info you’d like to include, ensuring the cover page fits your needs every time.
Can each practitioner send a fax from their own fax number?
The Documo plan for Jane customers includes 3 fax numbers, but only one can be set as the default at a time. The default number is the one faxes in Jane will be sent from, and the one that replies will be sent to.
💡
Jane tip
: if you’d like an inbound fax to go to a different fax number than the number you’re sending from, you can add that into the Notes section of the Cover Page when sending a fax.
You can set your default number in Documo via
Fax > My Fax Numbers > Set Primary
. You cannot easily switch between numbers from within Jane at this time.
