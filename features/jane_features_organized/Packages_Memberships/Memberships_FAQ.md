Redeeming or Refunding Memberships
If you’ve already reviewed those guides above, take a peek at these FAQ topics below:

Membership Setup
⭐ Can a product be covered as part of a Membership?
Not at this time. Only treatments and classes can be listed as eligible items as part of a Membership or Package.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I collect payment automatically without setting up a Membership?
No. In order to create a recurring invoice or collect payment automatically, you’ll first need to set up a Membership.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Is it possible to have an ongoing membership without expiry?
Not at this time. All memberships have an expiry date and once expired, a new membership can be sold to start a new term.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ If I edit a membership’s settings, will it affect the memberships I’ve already sold?
Great question. Only some membership settings can be updated on previously sold memberships. These are name, quantity, amount, income category, auto-selection, cancellation term, and eligible items.
Note
📍:
If you update the
Amount per Billing Cycle
for the membership, all valid memberships sold with have updated amounts for the next billing cycle.
If you want to update one of those settings on previously sold memberships, you’ll want to click the
Update All Memberships
button after you’ve made your changes:
If you want to edit a previously sold membership to change the
billing cycle
, or another setting that isn’t listed above, you’ll want to cancel the sold membership, update the membership settings, and then sell a new, updated membership.
🔝
Skip back to top
Selling a Membership
⭐ Where can I sell a Membership to a client?
A membership can be sold to a patient/ client by clicking
New Purchase > New Membership
from their
Profile > Billing > Packages & Memberships
area.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can my clients buy a membership online?
Selling a membership to a patient/client is an administrative-only feature at this time. Patients cannot pre-purchase memberships online via their
My Account
Portal or on the online booking site.
They will need to reach out to the clinic directly so that the membership sale can be added administratively to their billing.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can a membership be shared amongst family members or more than 1 patient?
Memberships can currently only be redeemed by the patient who purchased the membership. If several patients intend to share a membership, we recommend that a shared
gift card
is used instead. This will allow multiple patients to access and redeem the credit that has been loaded onto the card to cover the cost of their appointment.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ What’s the difference between
Manual
and
Automatic
payments?
The Payment Processing method will determine how the upcoming billing cycles of the membership will be paid. In both cases, invoices will be generated according to the billing schedule.
With
Manual Payments
, a clinic staff member will need to
Receive a Payment
to indicate how the invoice was paid— just as you would with a regular appointment or product sale. Users with Jane Payments will have access to
Automatic Payments.
When the next billing cycle is generated, a designated card on file will be automatically processed as payment.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I set up Automatic (Recurring) Payments for a membership if I am not using Jane Payments?
No. Automatic (recurring) payments are only available via the Jane Payments integration at this time.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I provide my patient with Membership Terms?
Yes, Jane will create Membership Terms based on your membership set up in your
Settings > Packages & Memberships
which you can provide to your client.
To access Membership Terms at the time of the sale, you can select
Print Membership Terms
.
To access Membership Terms after a sale, you can head over to the
Patient’s Profile
and then the
Billing
tab. Next, click on Packages & Memberships and View to the right of the membership.
In the top right corner, you’ll want to click on
Export Membership Terms
.
🔝
Skip back to top
Membership Management
⭐ What is the difference between deleting and cancelling a Membership?
Deleting
a membership is the best course of action if a membership was invoiced out of error. Otherwise,
cancelling
a membership will terminate any scheduled billing cycles and payments before the contract end date. If you’d like to learn more, we have an entire
guide document
dedicated to this specific question.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can a patient cancel their Membership on their own?
At this time, a patient is unable to cancel their membership themselves via the patient portal. A clinic staff member will be able to cancel the membership administratively on their behalf.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Are Clients Automatically Sent Membership Receipts?
Yes, when an automatic membership payment is taken, a patient will be sent a receipt automatically.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I change the credit card on an active membership between billing cycles?
Yes, you can change the credit card on file during an active membership.
In the patient’s profile, head to their
BIlling
tab
Go to
Packages & Memberships
& click on
View
Then, click on
Edit
If the new credit card hasn’t yet been added, click on
Add New Card
and input the card information
Select the new card as the Payment Method and
Save
to update
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ I want to cancel a membership, but it’s only showing me the option to delete.
Jane will show the option to delete a membership if all of the invoiced billing cycles are unpaid. If deleting is the preferred action (over cancelling), you’ll want to unapply any payments that have been applied towards the active billing cycles.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ I made a mistake and deleted/cancelled a membership by accident, can I undo this?
It is not possible to reverse a membership cancellation or deletion at this time. We recommend selling another instance of the same membership to your client.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I use a credit that a patient has on file to pay for their next automatic membership billing cycle?
No. At this time, you cannot use a patient’s credit on file to pay for an automatic membership billing cycle. Only credit cards can be used for auto-billing on memberships in Jane. If your memberships are set up for manual payments, this is an option!
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can a patient pause their Membership and resume it at a later date?
Not at this time. A membership cannot be paused, however, you can cancel the membership and begin a new one at a later date, if needed. We recognize that there are occasionally circumstances where a patient may need to pause their membership, such as going through a major life event or financial hardship. We hope to add the ability to pause a membership in future iterations of this feature!
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Will unused services in a membership cycle rollover to the next billing cycle?
No, at this time, unused redemptions within the current billing cycle will not roll over.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can the payment method be changed for a membership partway through?
Yes, you can change the method of payment for a membership that has already started.
If you head to the
Billing
section of a patient’s profile and navigate to
Packages & Memberships
, you will be able to
View
the membership that you have sold. From here, you’ll be able to
Edit
the membership.
If billing automatically, you can select an alternate card or
Add a New
Credit Card that you’d like to bill. If you want to record payments for the membership outside of Jane Payments, you can set the payment processing for this membership as
Manually
.
Note 📝
If you would like to modify a payment for a previously collected membership invoice, you might consider
refunding the patient payment
so that you can collect on the membership invoice with an alternate payment method.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Where can I find a list of patients with memberships?
A staff member with
Administrative/All Billing access or higher
can head over to the
Reports
tab and select
Package and Membership Sales
within the left sidebar menu. For more information on this report, you can check out our
Package & Membership Reports
guide for more details.

We often find that once we release a feature, as big as something like Memberships, there is an opportunity to elevate the feature to fit your needs (even more!). So, we’d love it if you’d send us an email at
support@jane.app
to share your feedback so that we can learn what you like (and what you would like to see) as we continue planning for the future. 🙏 Or, join the conversation in our
community group on Facebook

Is it possible to have an ongoing membership without expiry?
If I edit a membership’s settings, will it affect the memberships I’ve already sold?

Membership Setup
⭐ Can a product be covered as part of a Membership?
Not at this time. Only treatments and classes can be listed as eligible items as part of a Membership or Package.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I collect payment automatically without setting up a Membership?
No. In order to create a recurring invoice or collect payment automatically, you’ll first need to set up a Membership.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Is it possible to have an ongoing membership without expiry?
Not at this time. All memberships have an expiry date and once expired, a new membership can be sold to start a new term.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ If I edit a membership’s settings, will it affect the memberships I’ve already sold?
Great question. Only some membership settings can be updated on previously sold memberships. These are name, quantity, amount, income category, auto-selection, cancellation term, and eligible items.
Note
📍:
If you update the
Amount per Billing Cycle
for the membership, all valid memberships sold with have updated amounts for the next billing cycle.
If you want to update one of those settings on previously sold memberships, you’ll want to click the
Update All Memberships
button after you’ve made your changes:
If you want to edit a previously sold membership to change the
billing cycle
, or another setting that isn’t listed above, you’ll want to cancel the sold membership, update the membership settings, and then sell a new, updated membership.
🔝
Skip back to top
Selling a Membership
⭐ Where can I sell a Membership to a client?
A membership can be sold to a patient/ client by clicking
New Purchase > New Membership
from their
Profile > Billing > Packages & Memberships
area.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can my clients buy a membership online?
Selling a membership to a patient/client is an administrative-only feature at this time. Patients cannot pre-purchase memberships online via their
My Account
Portal or on the online booking site.
They will need to reach out to the clinic directly so that the membership sale can be added administratively to their billing.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can a membership be shared amongst family members or more than 1 patient?
Memberships can currently only be redeemed by the patient who purchased the membership. If several patients intend to share a membership, we recommend that a shared
gift card
is used instead. This will allow multiple patients to access and redeem the credit that has been loaded onto the card to cover the cost of their appointment.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ What’s the difference between
Manual
and
Automatic
payments?
The Payment Processing method will determine how the upcoming billing cycles of the membership will be paid. In both cases, invoices will be generated according to the billing schedule.
With
Manual Payments
, a clinic staff member will need to
Receive a Payment
to indicate how the invoice was paid— just as you would with a regular appointment or product sale. Users with Jane Payments will have access to
Automatic Payments.
When the next billing cycle is generated, a designated card on file will be automatically processed as payment.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I set up Automatic (Recurring) Payments for a membership if I am not using Jane Payments?
No. Automatic (recurring) payments are only available via the Jane Payments integration at this time.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I provide my patient with Membership Terms?
Yes, Jane will create Membership Terms based on your membership set up in your
Settings > Packages & Memberships
which you can provide to your client.
To access Membership Terms at the time of the sale, you can select
Print Membership Terms
.
To access Membership Terms after a sale, you can head over to the
Patient’s Profile
and then the
Billing
tab. Next, click on Packages & Memberships and View to the right of the membership.
In the top right corner, you’ll want to click on
Export Membership Terms
.
🔝
Skip back to top
Membership Management
⭐ What is the difference between deleting and cancelling a Membership?
Deleting
a membership is the best course of action if a membership was invoiced out of error. Otherwise,
cancelling
a membership will terminate any scheduled billing cycles and payments before the contract end date. If you’d like to learn more, we have an entire
guide document
dedicated to this specific question.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can a patient cancel their Membership on their own?
At this time, a patient is unable to cancel their membership themselves via the patient portal. A clinic staff member will be able to cancel the membership administratively on their behalf.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Are Clients Automatically Sent Membership Receipts?
Yes, when an automatic membership payment is taken, a patient will be sent a receipt automatically.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I change the credit card on an active membership between billing cycles?
Yes, you can change the credit card on file during an active membership.
In the patient’s profile, head to their
BIlling
tab
Go to
Packages & Memberships
& click on
View
Then, click on
Edit
If the new credit card hasn’t yet been added, click on
Add New Card
and input the card information
Select the new card as the Payment Method and
Save
to update
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ I want to cancel a membership, but it’s only showing me the option to delete.
Jane will show the option to delete a membership if all of the invoiced billing cycles are unpaid. If deleting is the preferred action (over cancelling), you’ll want to unapply any payments that have been applied towards the active billing cycles.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ I made a mistake and deleted/cancelled a membership by accident, can I undo this?
It is not possible to reverse a membership cancellation or deletion at this time. We recommend selling another instance of the same membership to your client.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I use a credit that a patient has on file to pay for their next automatic membership billing cycle?
No. At this time, you cannot use a patient’s credit on file to pay for an automatic membership billing cycle. Only credit cards can be used for auto-billing on memberships in Jane. If your memberships are set up for manual payments, this is an option!
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can a patient pause their Membership and resume it at a later date?
Not at this time. A membership cannot be paused, however, you can cancel the membership and begin a new one at a later date, if needed. We recognize that there are occasionally circumstances where a patient may need to pause their membership, such as going through a major life event or financial hardship. We hope to add the ability to pause a membership in future iterations of this feature!
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Will unused services in a membership cycle rollover to the next billing cycle?
No, at this time, unused redemptions within the current billing cycle will not roll over.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can the payment method be changed for a membership partway through?
Yes, you can change the method of payment for a membership that has already started.
If you head to the
Billing
section of a patient’s profile and navigate to
Packages & Memberships
, you will be able to
View
the membership that you have sold. From here, you’ll be able to
Edit
the membership.
If billing automatically, you can select an alternate card or
Add a New
Credit Card that you’d like to bill. If you want to record payments for the membership outside of Jane Payments, you can set the payment processing for this membership as
Manually
.
Note 📝
If you would like to modify a payment for a previously collected membership invoice, you might consider
refunding the patient payment
so that you can collect on the membership invoice with an alternate payment method.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Where can I find a list of patients with memberships?
A staff member with
Administrative/All Billing access or higher
can head over to the
Reports
tab and select
Package and Membership Sales
within the left sidebar menu. For more information on this report, you can check out our
Package & Membership Reports
guide for more details.
