Packages, punch cards, passes— oh my! 🎟📦🎁
No matter how you refer to them, Packages are a great way to provide additional incentives to your clients to maintain a regularly scheduled healthcare routine, meanwhile offering a little discount to sweeten the deal: it’s a win-win!
In this guide, we will cover what exactly a package deal is and how to set one up in your Jane account. There are also a few additional case studies of some example packages at the end of the guide, to demonstrate some of the different scenarios for how these packages can be used.
What is a Package?
Setting up a Package
Additional Setup Examples
Packages are a handy feature in Jane, but you might be scratching your head about how they work for clients who need insurance-friendly receipts. Take a look at our
Insurance Friendly Packages
guide for a detailed breakdown of how to set this up.
What is a Package?
A package is a non-recurring, one-time purchase that provides a patient with discounted access to a certain number of eligible sessions. Packages are valid for redemption for a preset amount of time and can encompass multiple types of appointment offerings.
At this time, packages can not be used to redeem for product purchases (treatments or classes only) or be set to automatically renew on a scheduled basis.
Note:
We always recommend checking with your regulating body to ensure this feature allows you to follow your local guidelines.
Setting Up a Package
To get started with setting up a new Package, a staff member with
Administrative/All Billing
or
Full Access
will be able to head over to the
Settings > Packages & Memberships
area of their account and click on the
New Package or Membership
button
.
From here, you’ll be able to start specifying the details of your new package deal:
📍
Name:
Give a name to the package deal that you will be offering— keep in mind that this will be used for both internal use and on client-facing documents.
📍
Amount:
This is the value of the entire package deal that the patient will be paying upfront.
📍
Taxes & Price Includes Tax:
You’ll also be able to indicate whether the upfront package sale is taxable. If so, tick off the applicable taxes and indicate whether or not the Amount is before or inclusive of tax.
📍
Income Category
: You can assign an
income category
of which these package sales will fall under. This will apply to the actual upfront sale of the package itself, but the individual treatments themselves will fall under the income category that has been set under the
Treatments & Classes > Edit
area.
In the example below, we’ve created a new Package called the “Acupuncture 10-Pack” which costs $500.00 upfront, is non-taxable, and is assigned to the Treatment Income category.
Next, we can specify the Usage and Eligibility preferences.
📍
Package Expiry:
How long the package is valid for. After the package expires, it is no longer available to be redeemed (even if there are uses remaining). Leave the checkbox blank for a package with no expiry, or enable and select a timeframe the package will be valid for.
📍
Quantity:
The number of “uses” or “punches” that are available to be redeemed for this particular package.
Given the settings above, our package is good for a total of 10 uses, and will expire 1 year from the date that it is invoiced.
📍
Automatically Redeem Online:
If a patient (a) has a valid package and (b) is booking online, if (c) this option is enabled, then Jane will automatically apply the first available package to the appointment upon booking. This is a handy setting that can help save a bit of time for your administrative staff.
Now that our package is taking shape, we can specify which sessions are eligible to be redeemed under this particular package deal. The options in the
Eligible Items
field are pre-populated based on the existing
Treatments and Classes
that you have set up for your clinic.
In the case of our Acupuncture 10-Pack, we want to specify that this package is good to be redeemed for either an initial or a subsequent treatment.
Jane will display the length of time and default price that has been set for those items.
Next to each eligible item are two columns: the first being
Additional Charge
and the second,
Staff Compensation
. These fields help specify a couple of additional billing aspects when a package is used for this particular appointment type.
📍
Additional Charge
: This field indicates any
additional
payment you want to collect from your patient for this particular type of appointment. The most common style of package is where a patient pays the full value of the package upfront, and there is no additional cost per appointment. In this case, you would want to set this field to $0.
However, there may be instances where a non-zero amount is collected from the patient for each session. In these cases, an amount can be entered into this field.
For example, a clinic might charge an initial fee of $100 upfront for the package, so the “Amount” field we saw earlier is set to $100. However, for each individual session that the package is used for, the patient is required to pay an additional $10 after completion. In this case, we would want to then set the
Additional Charge
field to $10.00 to reflect this additional fee.
📍
Staff Compensation:
This field determines how much the individual session is worth
prior to commission
on a staff member’s Compensation Report. As packages often offer a slight discount to patients for pre-paying for multiple packages at a time, the actual value per session may be lower than the typical standalone amount.
For example, let’s imagine that a standard treatment costs $110. However, if a patient buys themselves a pack of five treatments, they only have to pay $500 upfront (rather than $550, for $50 worth of savings).
Depending on the compensation model of the clinic, for each individual treatment redeemed by a package, the clinic might want to base the commission off of $110 per treatment (the original rate) OR $100 per treatment (the discounted rate).
And that’s all there is to it! Once the package has been created, you can begin to
Sell and Redeem Packages
for your reference.
Additional Setup Examples
This section will go over a few additional examples of setting up a package to clarify the relationship between the Amount, Additional Charge and Staff Compensation fields.
🌟
Example #1: Pay upfront for a set number of treatments at a discounted rate
The most straightforward version of a package. In this example, the clinic is offering a package of 10 chiropractic adjustments. Typically a single follow-up adjustment session costs $50.00, but if the patient pays for 10 sessions upfront, they get a $5.00 discount per session ($45.00 each) for a total of $450.00. In this configuration, the client would get a receipt upfront for their initial payment, and all subsequent sessions would have a $0 receipt.
Since the patient is required to pay upfront, the
Amount
field is set to $450.00, and the individual
Additional Charge
value for each session is $0.00 (since the patient has already covered the cost of the appointment).
In this case, the clinic has decided to compensate their staff based on the original treatment price, $50.00. This represents what 100% commission would look like if this particular treatment type is covered by a package.
🌟
Example #2: No upfront payment, but pay the discounted rate at the time of session
This is another way of interpreting a package deal! To use the same scenario as above, imagine the clinic wants to offer a $5.00 discount for ten chiropractic appointments (usually priced at $50.00 each). However, instead of the patient paying the entire value of the package upfront, the clinic wants to collect the payment as the patient completes their appointment. With this configuration, the patient would receive a $0 receipt for the initial invoicing of the package, and then receive an individual receipt for each session reflecting the discounted rate.
The
Amount
field is set to $0.00 since no initial payment is collected upfront, but the individual
Additional Charge
field is set to $45.00 per session.
Just like in Example #1, the clinic wants to compensate a staff member based on each treatment being valued at $50.00.
🌟
Example #3: Buy some, get one free
In this setup, the clinic is looking to offer a buy-some-get-some free model. A standard appointment costs $60.00, but if a patient purchases a package they will be saving the value of an appointment so they are charged $540.00 upfront.
The package can be used for 10 sessions, and for each individual appointment that is arrived in the schedule, the patient does not pay any additional fee.
The clinic has decided that the staff who offers the session will be compensated based on the after-discount rate, so rather than basing their commission on a value of $60.00 per session, the commission is based on $54.00 instead ($540.00 divided by 10).
Have you noticed that this example is very similar to Example #1? The concept of getting one “free” is a difference in how the offer/discount is communicated to your clients — but there isn’t anything fancy that you need to set up on Jane’s side of things!
🌟
Example #4: Pay for X sessions, discount after threshold is met
This clinic wants to offer a package model where a client can come in pretty much as many times as they’d like for a pilates class within a month’s time. Essentially, the first three pilates sessions are full price to the patient, but any additional sessions after that is only $5.00—what a deal! Let’s break this down:
A standard pilates appointment is $25.00, so three sessions would normally cost $75.00 without any special rate. The patient pays $60.00 upfront for the unlimited package, and each time they come in they just have to pay $5.00 out of pocket.
After the third use, the patient would have made their money’s worth by spending a total of $75.00 and any additional times they come in for an appointment that month would cost only $5.00. The quantity has been set to a large number (50 in this case) to allow the patient to come in as often as they’d like during the month.
The clinic has chosen to compensate the staff member who hosts the pilates class the full $25.00 per session.
🌟
Example #5: Multiple eligible sessions, additional surcharge for certain treatment types
This clinic offers a Multi-Massage package which costs $360 upfront, and can be used for a total of six times for either the 30, 45, or 60 minute appointment times. This would be a good offer for clients whose massage appointment time varies.
If the client came in for six 30-minute appointments, the patient wouldn’t really be getting much of a discount. However, if they came in for say three 30-minute and three 45-minute massages, the standard value of these appointments would have been $450, so that’s a good amount of savings!
The clinic has also specified that if the client wishes to redeem a package for a 60-minute appointment, they will be able to do so but for a $10.00 additional fee.
Compensation for the providers have been set so their compensation is based off $60 for each 30- and 45-minute session, whereas the compensation for a 60-minute massage is a little bit higher at $70.

Packages, punch cards, passes— oh my! 🎟📦🎁
No matter how you refer to them, Packages are a great way to provide additional incentives to your clients to maintain a regularly scheduled healthcare routine, meanwhile offering a little discount to sweeten the deal: it’s a win-win!
In this guide, we will cover what exactly a package deal is and how to set one up in your Jane account. There are also a few additional case studies of some example packages at the end of the guide, to demonstrate some of the different scenarios for how these packages can be used.
What is a Package?
Setting up a Package
Additional Setup Examples
Packages are a handy feature in Jane, but you might be scratching your head about how they work for clients who need insurance-friendly receipts. Take a look at our
Insurance Friendly Packages
guide for a detailed breakdown of how to set this up.
What is a Package?
A package is a non-recurring, one-time purchase that provides a patient with discounted access to a certain number of eligible sessions. Packages are valid for redemption for a preset amount of time and can encompass multiple types of appointment offerings.
At this time, packages can not be used to redeem for product purchases (treatments or classes only) or be set to automatically renew on a scheduled basis.
Note:
We always recommend checking with your regulating body to ensure this feature allows you to follow your local guidelines.
Setting Up a Package
To get started with setting up a new Package, a staff member with
Administrative/All Billing
or
Full Access
will be able to head over to the
Settings > Packages & Memberships
area of their account and click on the
New Package or Membership
button
.
From here, you’ll be able to start specifying the details of your new package deal:
📍
Name:
Give a name to the package deal that you will be offering— keep in mind that this will be used for both internal use and on client-facing documents.
📍
Amount:
This is the value of the entire package deal that the patient will be paying upfront.
📍
Taxes & Price Includes Tax:
You’ll also be able to indicate whether the upfront package sale is taxable. If so, tick off the applicable taxes and indicate whether or not the Amount is before or inclusive of tax.
📍
Income Category
: You can assign an
income category
of which these package sales will fall under. This will apply to the actual upfront sale of the package itself, but the individual treatments themselves will fall under the income category that has been set under the
Treatments & Classes > Edit
area.
In the example below, we’ve created a new Package called the “Acupuncture 10-Pack” which costs $500.00 upfront, is non-taxable, and is assigned to the Treatment Income category.
Next, we can specify the Usage and Eligibility preferences.
📍
Package Expiry:
How long the package is valid for. After the package expires, it is no longer available to be redeemed (even if there are uses remaining). Leave the checkbox blank for a package with no expiry, or enable and select a timeframe the package will be valid for.
📍
Quantity:
The number of “uses” or “punches” that are available to be redeemed for this particular package.
Given the settings above, our package is good for a total of 10 uses, and will expire 1 year from the date that it is invoiced.
📍
Automatically Redeem Online:
If a patient (a) has a valid package and (b) is booking online, if (c) this option is enabled, then Jane will automatically apply the first available package to the appointment upon booking. This is a handy setting that can help save a bit of time for your administrative staff.
Now that our package is taking shape, we can specify which sessions are eligible to be redeemed under this particular package deal. The options in the
Eligible Items
field are pre-populated based on the existing
Treatments and Classes
that you have set up for your clinic.
In the case of our Acupuncture 10-Pack, we want to specify that this package is good to be redeemed for either an initial or a subsequent treatment.
Jane will display the length of time and default price that has been set for those items.
Next to each eligible item are two columns: the first being
Additional Charge
and the second,
Staff Compensation
. These fields help specify a couple of additional billing aspects when a package is used for this particular appointment type.
📍
Additional Charge
: This field indicates any
additional
payment you want to collect from your patient for this particular type of appointment. The most common style of package is where a patient pays the full value of the package upfront, and there is no additional cost per appointment. In this case, you would want to set this field to $0.
However, there may be instances where a non-zero amount is collected from the patient for each session. In these cases, an amount can be entered into this field.
For example, a clinic might charge an initial fee of $100 upfront for the package, so the “Amount” field we saw earlier is set to $100. However, for each individual session that the package is used for, the patient is required to pay an additional $10 after completion. In this case, we would want to then set the
Additional Charge
field to $10.00 to reflect this additional fee.
📍
Staff Compensation:
This field determines how much the individual session is worth
prior to commission
on a staff member’s Compensation Report. As packages often offer a slight discount to patients for pre-paying for multiple packages at a time, the actual value per session may be lower than the typical standalone amount.
For example, let’s imagine that a standard treatment costs $110. However, if a patient buys themselves a pack of five treatments, they only have to pay $500 upfront (rather than $550, for $50 worth of savings).
Depending on the compensation model of the clinic, for each individual treatment redeemed by a package, the clinic might want to base the commission off of $110 per treatment (the original rate) OR $100 per treatment (the discounted rate).
And that’s all there is to it! Once the package has been created, you can begin to
Sell and Redeem Packages
for your reference.
Additional Setup Examples
This section will go over a few additional examples of setting up a package to clarify the relationship between the Amount, Additional Charge and Staff Compensation fields.
🌟
Example #1: Pay upfront for a set number of treatments at a discounted rate
The most straightforward version of a package. In this example, the clinic is offering a package of 10 chiropractic adjustments. Typically a single follow-up adjustment session costs $50.00, but if the patient pays for 10 sessions upfront, they get a $5.00 discount per session ($45.00 each) for a total of $450.00. In this configuration, the client would get a receipt upfront for their initial payment, and all subsequent sessions would have a $0 receipt.
Since the patient is required to pay upfront, the
Amount
field is set to $450.00, and the individual
Additional Charge
value for each session is $0.00 (since the patient has already covered the cost of the appointment).
In this case, the clinic has decided to compensate their staff based on the original treatment price, $50.00. This represents what 100% commission would look like if this particular treatment type is covered by a package.
🌟
Example #2: No upfront payment, but pay the discounted rate at the time of session
This is another way of interpreting a package deal! To use the same scenario as above, imagine the clinic wants to offer a $5.00 discount for ten chiropractic appointments (usually priced at $50.00 each). However, instead of the patient paying the entire value of the package upfront, the clinic wants to collect the payment as the patient completes their appointment. With this configuration, the patient would receive a $0 receipt for the initial invoicing of the package, and then receive an individual receipt for each session reflecting the discounted rate.
The
Amount
field is set to $0.00 since no initial payment is collected upfront, but the individual
Additional Charge
field is set to $45.00 per session.
Just like in Example #1, the clinic wants to compensate a staff member based on each treatment being valued at $50.00.
🌟
Example #3: Buy some, get one free
In this setup, the clinic is looking to offer a buy-some-get-some free model. A standard appointment costs $60.00, but if a patient purchases a package they will be saving the value of an appointment so they are charged $540.00 upfront.
The package can be used for 10 sessions, and for each individual appointment that is arrived in the schedule, the patient does not pay any additional fee.
The clinic has decided that the staff who offers the session will be compensated based on the after-discount rate, so rather than basing their commission on a value of $60.00 per session, the commission is based on $54.00 instead ($540.00 divided by 10).
Have you noticed that this example is very similar to Example #1? The concept of getting one “free” is a difference in how the offer/discount is communicated to your clients — but there isn’t anything fancy that you need to set up on Jane’s side of things!
🌟
Example #4: Pay for X sessions, discount after threshold is met
This clinic wants to offer a package model where a client can come in pretty much as many times as they’d like for a pilates class within a month’s time. Essentially, the first three pilates sessions are full price to the patient, but any additional sessions after that is only $5.00—what a deal! Let’s break this down:
A standard pilates appointment is $25.00, so three sessions would normally cost $75.00 without any special rate. The patient pays $60.00 upfront for the unlimited package, and each time they come in they just have to pay $5.00 out of pocket.
After the third use, the patient would have made their money’s worth by spending a total of $75.00 and any additional times they come in for an appointment that month would cost only $5.00. The quantity has been set to a large number (50 in this case) to allow the patient to come in as often as they’d like during the month.
The clinic has chosen to compensate the staff member who hosts the pilates class the full $25.00 per session.
🌟
Example #5: Multiple eligible sessions, additional surcharge for certain treatment types
This clinic offers a Multi-Massage package which costs $360 upfront, and can be used for a total of six times for either the 30, 45, or 60 minute appointment times. This would be a good offer for clients whose massage appointment time varies.
If the client came in for six 30-minute appointments, the patient wouldn’t really be getting much of a discount. However, if they came in for say three 30-minute and three 45-minute massages, the standard value of these appointments would have been $450, so that’s a good amount of savings!
The clinic has also specified that if the client wishes to redeem a package for a 60-minute appointment, they will be able to do so but for a $10.00 additional fee.
Compensation for the providers have been set so their compensation is based off $60 for each 30- and 45-minute session, whereas the compensation for a 60-minute massage is a little bit higher at $70.
