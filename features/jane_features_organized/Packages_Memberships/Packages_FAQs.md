This guide is a compilation of some of the most frequently asked questions about Jane’s Packages feature. If you haven’t seen them already, we have a handful of packages guides on several topics:
Setting Up a Package
Selling, Redeeming and Refunding a Package
Package Sales & Usage Reports
Working with Package & Membership Receipts
Understanding Package Compensation
If a package has been invoiced to a client and payment has not been collected, the option to
delete
the package invoice will be available from the drop-down under the Profile > Billing > Purchases area.
If a payment has already been applied, but this package was invoiced by mistake, the payment must first be
unapplied
in order for this delete option to be available.
Can a package be shared between 2 patients or family members?
Packages can currently only be redeemed by the patient who purchased the package, so a package can’t be shared or transferred to another person. If several patients intend to share a package, we recommend that a shared
gift card
is used instead. This will allow multiple patients to access and redeem the credit that has been loaded onto the card to cover the cost of their appointment.
Can my patients purchase a package online?
No
, packages can only be sold to a patient from the administrative side of Jane. Patients cannot pre-purchase packages on the patient-facing side of the online booking site.
In cases where the patient would like to purchase a package, they will need to contact the clinic directly. The clinic can then input the package sale on behalf of the patient. If a patient has purchased a package, they can log in to their
My Account Portal
and go to the
Packages & Memberships
tab to view all package details, including purchase date, name, and usage. This helps patients easily keep track of their packages in one convenient place.
One option is to add a message to your online banner, letting patients know that if they’d like to purchase a package, they can give the clinic a call and you can process the sale administratively.
For more information on how to add a message to your online booking site, you can head on over to our
Notice/Message on Online Booking Pages
guide for more details!
If a client or patient contacts the clinic to purchase a package and your clinic is using Jane Payments, you can sell them a package through the administrative side of your Jane account without collecting payment initially.
From there, you can send them a
Pay Balance email
to collect payment for this package by heading on over to the
Patient’s Profile
and click
Email Reminder
under the
Billing Notices
widget.
Once you click the
Email Reminder
button, it will give you the option to write a message before the email goes out.
With that being said, it does look like our Jane community has been a bit vocal about wanting the ability to sell packages online.  You can add your vote along with any feedback that you want to share to the following post
here
Will a receipt for a package visit populate the amount of sessions remaining on the package?
Not at this time. If the clinic looks to generate a receipt for a visit where a package was used, Jane will only populate the name of the package used and not the amount of visits left on that package.
How can I review the number of sessions or treatments patients have left on their packages or memberships?
On the administrative side, there are a couple of different places where Jane displays this information.
Package & Memberships Usage Report
If you’re looking for package usage for more than one patient at a time, a staff member with
Administrative/All Billing access or higher
can head over to the
Reports
tab and click on
Package & Membership Usage
within the left sidebar menu.
You can use the filters to narrow down the data to a specific location, staff member, date range, Package or Membership type or pass type. For more details on this report, you can check out our
Package & Membership Reports
guide.
Patient Profile
For specific clients, you can head over to their
Profile,
click on the
Billing
tab within their profile and then on
Packages & Memberships
. Jane will display the number of remaining sessions or treatments within the
Usage
column.
Schedule
If the package is being redeemed on an eligible appointment, Jane also displays their usage at a glance. You can view this either while you’re booking the appointment or if you click on the appointment within the
Schedule
tab.
You’ll just want to scroll down to the
Billing Info
section of the
Appointment Panel
.
Is it possible to set up a package that auto-invoices/recurs every month/week/year, etc.?
While a package is a one-time purchase, you might be interested in
memberships
. A membership can have multiple recurring invoices and either a fixed or unlimited number of uses, like a subscription. Since clients can be set up to be invoiced at regular intervals, payments can be scheduled to automatically process a card on file via
Jane Payments
if available.
How can I automatically apply packages to clients attending group appointments?
The
Primary Client
is the only one who receives an invoice (which lists all the Secondary Clients who attended). To use a package for payment, make sure your
Primary Client
is the one with the package.
Want each participant to use their own packages? You’ll need a
Class Booking
instead. While you can’t directly convert a Group Appointment to a Class Booking, there’s an easy fix!
A staff member with
Administrative/All Billing
access can
duplicate the group appointment
and then change the appointment type to
Class Booking
.
Can I rename a package that has been sold to patients already?
Yes
, a staff member with
Administrative/All Billing
access can head over to the
Settings
tab, click on
Packages & Memberships
within the left sidebar menu and then click on
Edit
to the right of the package.
Next, you can update the name of the package in the first field at the top of the page. From there, make sure to scroll down and click on the blue
Update
button to confirm those changes.
On the next page, Jane will ask if you’d like to update packages that were previously sold to patients. Make sure to click on the
Update Sold Packages
button to finalize.
Note
📝:
You can also update the quantity, income category, auto-selection and or eligible items for sold packages.
Can I set a package to “no expiry”?
Yes! The option to select “no expiry” as a default is available while setting up a package. A friendly reminder that you will be able to modify the expiry date for a package on an individual basis by visiting the package show page (under Profile > Billing > Packages > View). Leaving the expiry date blank will set the package to never expire. Visit our guide on
Selling & Redeeming a Package
to learn more about package expiry.
I’d like to sell a package to a client, but they will be paying in installments; how do I manage this in Jane?
A package must be fully paid for it to be available for redemption moving forward. With installment plans, only a portion of the payment may be collected at one time. If this describes your style of package, you may want to consider creating separate packages for each of the different installments so that you can keep track of how many payments are remaining.
I work with a package that has individual limits (e.g. max 5 uses for session A, and max 5 uses for session B, for a total of ten uses), how do I manage this in Jane?
Your clinic may offer packages that are eligible for a certain number of sessions
per treatment type
, e.g. up to 5 acupuncture treatments and up to 5 massage treatments. However, there are currently no individual limits to the number of sessions by treatment type within a package, only a global limit (e.g. 10 in this case). In this type of package setup, we would recommend creating a separate mini-package for each of the individual offers. You could then sell both of the packages to your client at the same time so that you can keep track of the individual limits for each treatment type.
Why isn’t a package showing up on the appointment?
There are a couple of reasons why you may not be seeing the package show up when you’re trying to redeem it for a patient’s visit.
Eligible Items
The eligible items added to the set up of the package may not match the appointment type you’ve booked in. To view the list of eligible treatments for the package, a
Full Access
user can head over to the
Settings
tab, and click on
Packages & Memberships
within the left sidebar menu. Next, click on
Edit
to the right of the package you’d like to update.
Scroll down to the
Eligible Items
section and Jane will display a list of all the treatment types that the package can be redeemed toward. If you’re not seeing the treatment type listed, you can click on the blue
Add Eligible Item
text.
On the last page, make sure to hit the blue
Update Sold Packages
to confirm those changes and update those sold packages.
Already Fully  Redeemed
Sometimes the package might already be fully redeemed, which can happen in two ways:
A staff member booked appointments copied from their previous visit - sneaky! This would automatically have the package added to a visit in the future
The package settings allow for patients to redeem the package online while they’re booking their appointments through the Online Booking site.
To update the appointments the package is attached to,  head over to the
Patient’s Profile
, the
Billing
tab within the Profile and then click on
Packages & Memberships
.
Next, click on
View
to the right of the appointment.
Jane will open up the appointment and purchase details. From here, you’ll scroll down to the
Packages & Memberships
section, and click on the blue
X
to the right of the name of the package to remove it from the appointment.
With the package removed from all upcoming appointments, you should be able to add it to any eligible appointment type. If you’re still running into issues with redeeming a package after walking through these troubleshooting steps, please
reach out to our support team
and we’d be happy to help!
I’d like to collect an upfront payment for a package, but also provide my clients with a non-zero discounted receipt for each session — how can I do this?
📣 Since filming the below video, “Patient Pays” was updated to “Additional Charge”. Don’t worry, all the steps to set up insurer-friendly packages are the same.
This package method is well-suited for clinics that have patients submitting their receipts to insurance — we put together a quick video to go over the setup requirements.
If you’d like to see this workflow broken down into further detail, we also have a guide dedicated to
Insurance Friendly Packages
which we recommend checking out.

Packages FAQs
14 min read
Thrive Plan
Legacy PlansThis guide is a compilation of some of the most frequently asked questions about Jane’s Packages feature. If you haven’t seen them already, we have a handful of packages guides on several topics:
Setting Up a Package
Selling, Redeeming and Refunding a Package
Package Sales & Usage Reports
Working with Package & Membership Receipts
Understanding Package Compensation
If a package has been invoiced to a client and payment has not been collected, the option to
delete
the package invoice will be available from the drop-down under the Profile > Billing > Purchases area.
If a payment has already been applied, but this package was invoiced by mistake, the payment must first be
unapplied
in order for this delete option to be available.
Can a package be shared between 2 patients or family members?
Packages can currently only be redeemed by the patient who purchased the package, so a package can’t be shared or transferred to another person. If several patients intend to share a package, we recommend that a shared
gift card
is used instead. This will allow multiple patients to access and redeem the credit that has been loaded onto the card to cover the cost of their appointment.
Can my patients purchase a package online?
No
, packages can only be sold to a patient from the administrative side of Jane. Patients cannot pre-purchase packages on the patient-facing side of the online booking site.
In cases where the patient would like to purchase a package, they will need to contact the clinic directly. The clinic can then input the package sale on behalf of the patient. If a patient has purchased a package, they can log in to their
My Account Portal
and go to the
Packages & Memberships
tab to view all package details, including purchase date, name, and usage. This helps patients easily keep track of their packages in one convenient place.
One option is to add a message to your online banner, letting patients know that if they’d like to purchase a package, they can give the clinic a call and you can process the sale administratively.
For more information on how to add a message to your online booking site, you can head on over to our
Notice/Message on Online Booking Pages
guide for more details!
If a client or patient contacts the clinic to purchase a package and your clinic is using Jane Payments, you can sell them a package through the administrative side of your Jane account without collecting payment initially.
From there, you can send them a
Pay Balance email
to collect payment for this package by heading on over to the
Patient’s Profile
and click
Email Reminder
under the
Billing Notices
widget.
Once you click the
Email Reminder
button, it will give you the option to write a message before the email goes out.
With that being said, it does look like our Jane community has been a bit vocal about wanting the ability to sell packages online.  You can add your vote along with any feedback that you want to share to the following post
here
Will a receipt for a package visit populate the amount of sessions remaining on the package?
Not at this time. If the clinic looks to generate a receipt for a visit where a package was used, Jane will only populate the name of the package used and not the amount of visits left on that package.
How can I review the number of sessions or treatments patients have left on their packages or memberships?
On the administrative side, there are a couple of different places where Jane displays this information.
Package & Memberships Usage Report
If you’re looking for package usage for more than one patient at a time, a staff member with
Administrative/All Billing access or higher
can head over to the
Reports
tab and click on
Package & Membership Usage
within the left sidebar menu.
You can use the filters to narrow down the data to a specific location, staff member, date range, Package or Membership type or pass type. For more details on this report, you can check out our
Package & Membership Reports
guide.
Patient Profile
For specific clients, you can head over to their
Profile,
click on the
Billing
tab within their profile and then on
Packages & Memberships
. Jane will display the number of remaining sessions or treatments within the
Usage
column.
Schedule
If the package is being redeemed on an eligible appointment, Jane also displays their usage at a glance. You can view this either while you’re booking the appointment or if you click on the appointment within the
Schedule
tab.
You’ll just want to scroll down to the
Billing Info
section of the
Appointment Panel
.
Is it possible to set up a package that auto-invoices/recurs every month/week/year, etc.?
While a package is a one-time purchase, you might be interested in
memberships
. A membership can have multiple recurring invoices and either a fixed or unlimited number of uses, like a subscription. Since clients can be set up to be invoiced at regular intervals, payments can be scheduled to automatically process a card on file via
Jane Payments
if available.
How can I automatically apply packages to clients attending group appointments?
The
Primary Client
is the only one who receives an invoice (which lists all the Secondary Clients who attended). To use a package for payment, make sure your
Primary Client
is the one with the package.
Want each participant to use their own packages? You’ll need a
Class Booking
instead. While you can’t directly convert a Group Appointment to a Class Booking, there’s an easy fix!
A staff member with
Administrative/All Billing
access can
duplicate the group appointment
and then change the appointment type to
Class Booking
.
Can I rename a package that has been sold to patients already?
Yes
, a staff member with
Administrative/All Billing
access can head over to the
Settings
tab, click on
Packages & Memberships
within the left sidebar menu and then click on
Edit
to the right of the package.
Next, you can update the name of the package in the first field at the top of the page. From there, make sure to scroll down and click on the blue
Update
button to confirm those changes.
On the next page, Jane will ask if you’d like to update packages that were previously sold to patients. Make sure to click on the
Update Sold Packages
button to finalize.
Note
📝:
You can also update the quantity, income category, auto-selection and or eligible items for sold packages.
Can I set a package to “no expiry”?
Yes! The option to select “no expiry” as a default is available while setting up a package. A friendly reminder that you will be able to modify the expiry date for a package on an individual basis by visiting the package show page (under Profile > Billing > Packages > View). Leaving the expiry date blank will set the package to never expire. Visit our guide on
Selling & Redeeming a Package
to learn more about package expiry.
I’d like to sell a package to a client, but they will be paying in installments; how do I manage this in Jane?
A package must be fully paid for it to be available for redemption moving forward. With installment plans, only a portion of the payment may be collected at one time. If this describes your style of package, you may want to consider creating separate packages for each of the different installments so that you can keep track of how many payments are remaining.
I work with a package that has individual limits (e.g. max 5 uses for session A, and max 5 uses for session B, for a total of ten uses), how do I manage this in Jane?
Your clinic may offer packages that are eligible for a certain number of sessions
per treatment type
, e.g. up to 5 acupuncture treatments and up to 5 massage treatments. However, there are currently no individual limits to the number of sessions by treatment type within a package, only a global limit (e.g. 10 in this case). In this type of package setup, we would recommend creating a separate mini-package for each of the individual offers. You could then sell both of the packages to your client at the same time so that you can keep track of the individual limits for each treatment type.
Why isn’t a package showing up on the appointment?
There are a couple of reasons why you may not be seeing the package show up when you’re trying to redeem it for a patient’s visit.
Eligible Items
The eligible items added to the set up of the package may not match the appointment type you’ve booked in. To view the list of eligible treatments for the package, a
Full Access
user can head over to the
Settings
tab, and click on
Packages & Memberships
within the left sidebar menu. Next, click on
Edit
to the right of the package you’d like to update.
Scroll down to the
Eligible Items
section and Jane will display a list of all the treatment types that the package can be redeemed toward. If you’re not seeing the treatment type listed, you can click on the blue
Add Eligible Item
text.
On the last page, make sure to hit the blue
Update Sold Packages
to confirm those changes and update those sold packages.
Already Fully  Redeemed
Sometimes the package might already be fully redeemed, which can happen in two ways:
A staff member booked appointments copied from their previous visit - sneaky! This would automatically have the package added to a visit in the future
The package settings allow for patients to redeem the package online while they’re booking their appointments through the Online Booking site.
To update the appointments the package is attached to,  head over to the
Patient’s Profile
, the
Billing
tab within the Profile and then click on
Packages & Memberships
.
Next, click on
View
to the right of the appointment.
Jane will open up the appointment and purchase details. From here, you’ll scroll down to the
Packages & Memberships
section, and click on the blue
X
to the right of the name of the package to remove it from the appointment.
With the package removed from all upcoming appointments, you should be able to add it to any eligible appointment type. If you’re still running into issues with redeeming a package after walking through these troubleshooting steps, please
reach out to our support team
and we’d be happy to help!
I’d like to collect an upfront payment for a package, but also provide my clients with a non-zero discounted receipt for each session — how can I do this?
📣 Since filming the below video, “Patient Pays” was updated to “Additional Charge”. Don’t worry, all the steps to set up insurer-friendly packages are the same.
This package method is well-suited for clinics that have patients submitting their receipts to insurance — we put together a quick video to go over the setup requirements.
If you’d like to see this workflow broken down into further detail, we also have a guide dedicated to
Insurance Friendly Packages
which we recommend checking out.Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.
