If you’re a current Jane user, you can find the login information by clicking the\nNeed Help?\nButton in your account. This password is updated every Monday.\nIf you haven’t signed up with Jane just yet, you can find the login password by heading to the\nJane Community Group\non Facebook and clicking the\nFeatured\ntab. You can also request the password by emailing\nsupport@jane.app\n.\nWe always recommend using the demo clinic for testing and practice so that your own account stays nice and tidy. ✨\nModule 2: Claim Submissions & Management\nAlright, now that we’ve gotten through the basics of getting the clinic set up for submitting insurance, it’s time to take a look at actually submitting the claims and the differences between electronic and paper submissions.\nFeel free to scroll through the guide, or hop to a specific section below:\nIntegrated Claims, CMS-1500s & EDI 837ps - What’s the Difference?\nResubmissions & Corrected Claims\nBatch CMS1500 Forms\nClaim Submission Folders\nAll insurance claims are managed under the main “\nBilling\n” tab in Jane.\nThe “\nClaim Submissions\n” area, found on the left, has several folders to keep all patient claims accounted for during the submission process.\nLet’s get to know a few of the Claim Submission Folders:\nThe\nDraft\nfolder is an optional folder used for reviewing claim information. You can set up your account so that all new claims start here. This folder can be helpful if you have dedicated billing staff who need to easily know which claims have been finalized (i.e. all billing codes have been entered) and are ready to be submitted. When your draft claims have been finalized, they can then be moved to the Unsubmitted folder by the practitioner.\nThe\nUnsubmitted\nfolder holds all insurance claims ready to be submitted. This is where you go to submit claims through our Claim.MD integration, or to generate electronic claim files to upload to Office Ally, TriZetto, or Availity.\nThe\nSubmitted\nfolder holds any claims that have been submitted, and are awaiting remittance from the insurance company.\nThe\nApproved\nfolder is your “Done” folder! It holds all claims that have received a claim response and there is no additional outstanding amount from the insurer.\nThe\nWaiting on Primary\nfolder holds any secondary claims that are awaiting primary claims’ adjudication. These secondary claims will automatically move toward your Unsubmitted folder (or Draft if you use this as your review area) once the remittance for any relevant primary has been recorded.\nFor Integrated Claims with Claim.MD customers, the Rejected folder displays claims that have been rejected by Claim.MD or the payer. You can see the rejection reason(s) in the Claim Summary panel.\nCan’t find a claim? Use the\nSearch\nfunction.\nIntegrated Claims, CMS-1500s & EDI 837ps - What’s the Difference?\nIntegrated Claims\nWhen\nintegrated with Claim.MD\n, you can submit claims directly from Jane. No need to download claim files and upload them manually in Claim.MD– Jane is your 1-stop shop here!\nEDI 837p\nElectronic Data Interchange (EDI) is the electronic exchange of business information in a standard format. Simply put, EDI is how different entities send and receive large amounts of data efficiently. These files are used for\nelectronic submission\nthrough clearinghouses, in our case you can submit an EDI created by Jane to these clearinghouses:\nOffice Ally\nClaim.MD\nTriZetto\nAvaility\nCMS-1500\nCMS-1500 is the standard paper claim form used to bill insurance for rendered services and supplies. It provides information about the client, their corresponding insurance policy, and their diagnosis and treatment. This information is the same that’s included in the EDI file, just organized for human eyes to read, as opposed to a computer.\nIf you do choose to go with paper submission, or even if you just need to understand where certain information is populating from in Jane, we’ve created this handy reference sheet for you to use:\nCMS-1500 Reference Sheet\n.\nSubmitting Claims through the Claim.MD Integration\nTo submit claims electronically, let’s head to the\nBilling Tab\nand select the\nUnsubmitted\n(or Draft) folder. From here, select the claims you’d like to submit.\nNext, click\nSubmit Selected Claims\nFrom here, Jane will do a quick health check of these claims to make sure the relevant information is here. If you forget any key pieces of your claim (like CPT codes), Jane will flag the claim for correction:\nOnce your claims are ready to go, you can click\nSubmit X Claims to Claim.MD\nbutton, at the bottom of the page:\nAaaaand, you’re golden 🎉\nThese claims will be sent directly to your\nClaim.MD\naccount for submission, and will be visible there within an hour.\n💡Did you know that, if you’re using Claim.MD, you can also complete eligibility checks right in Jane? Check out our guide on\nEligibility Checks\nfor more.\nNot yet using Claim.MD? Check out\nour guide on Integrated Claims\nalong with some\nfrequently asked questions\n. to learn more and get started.\nGenerating an EDI File for Claim Submission\nIf you’re submitting to Office Ally, Trizetto, or Availity; this is for you 👋\nThe process to generate an EDI for submission is similar to that of integrated claims:\nHead to the main\nBilling\ntab >\nUnsubmitted\nfolder\nSelect the claims you’d like to include in your batch.\nClick the\nSubmit Selected Claims\nbutton at the bottom of your screen and continue to the Pre-Submission Checklist.\nOnce all the fixes are made, then you can\ngenerate your EDI file.\nClick the\nDownload\nbutton in the top right corner. The EDI file includes all of these claims/dates of service, and then upload this file to your clearinghouse account.\nAnd voilà!\nYou can now take this EDI file to your clearinghouse and upload it to complete the submission process.\nAll submitted claims will now be moved from the Unsubmitted folder area, over to the Submitted folder awaiting payment.\nPractice Drill 🏈\nHop on to the Demo Clinic to do this next exercise!\nInstructions:\nHead into the\nBilling\ntab at the top of Jane and then select the\nUnsubmitted\nfolder.\nSelect a claim by clicking on the item, highlighting it blue.\nClick the Submit Selected Claims button at the bottom of your screen and continue to the Pre-Submission Checklist.\nFix any errors (marked by red boxes) that pop up on the submission by clicking\nEdit\nbeneath the notice.\nOnce the claim is ready for submission, continue to\nGenerate Submission for 1 Claim.\nNote that the claim will now be moved to the\nSubmitted Folder\nonce this is done.\nTouchdown! 📣\nResubmissions & Corrected Claims\nIf you need some help resubmitting a corrected claim, either with Jane’s integrated claims or EDI feature, we’ve included this handy guide doc for you here:\nManaging Resubmissions & Corrected Claims\n.\nPro tip: If you’re connected with Integrated Claims, you’ll see rejections come straight into your Rejected folder. You’ll be able to fix up your claims from there for a speedy resubmission process.\nAs always, if you’d like to read further on creating and submitting claims or generating EDI files in Jane, we’ve put together a very handy resource guide you can view in\nStep 5 of our US Insurance Billing Training\n.\nCMS1500 - Health Insurance Claim Form\nJane can generate a CMS1500 form into an editable PDF for paper claim submission, however Jane cannot print claim details directly onto a pre-printed CMS1500 form.\nOnce you have\nArrived\nan appointment and have added in all insurance claim information, you can click the downward arrow next to the “\nPay\n” button and select\nGenerate CMS1500\n:\nFrom the Draft or Unsubmitted folder, you can also generate a CMS1500 form by clicking the right side arrow, and selecting View Purchase. Jane will tell you if there are any missing fields and then generate the form:\nThis form can now be Printed, or edited further if required. For editing, it’s best to Save the form first and then make any needed edits to the downloaded copy.\nThe CMS1500 Forms will print best on blank paper. Some Payers can’t process the claim if it is printed in black and white, so printing in color is generally a good idea.\n📍\nNote: SOF stands for Signature on File. This is an accepted term but feel free to remove this if you are printing and signing.\nNeed a little help figuring out what’s supposed to go into each box (and where that info is coming from in Jane)? Check out\nStart Billing 4: Claim Management & CMS1500 Forms\nor take a look at our guide on\nInsurance claims and the CMS1500\nor our\nCMS1500 Reference Sheet\n.\nBatch CMS1500 Forms\nWant to export multiple CMS1500 forms in one go? If so, check out the following guide:\nGenerating a Batch: CMS1500s\n.\nPractice Drill 🏈\nHop on to the Demo Clinic to do this next exercise!\nInstructions:\nHead into the\nSchedule\ntab and select an appointment on the schedule with insurance attached.\nYou can easily find which appointments have insurance attached by the briefcase icon on their appointment.\nArrive\nthe appointment and select the dropdown menu next to\nPay\nClick\nGenerate CMS1500\nTouchdown! 📣\nExcellent! 🥳 Now that we know how to generate our submissions, let’s head on to\nModule 3: Modifiers, creating a custom billing code, and changing & adding billing codes\n.\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter.\nWelcome\nWelcome to the Jane Guide\nCode of Conduct\nFeature Requests\nJane's Brand Assets\nAccount Setup Consultations\nWhat's new in Jane?\nWhat's new in Jane Webinar\nJane's Changelog\nJane's Monthly Newsletter\nUpdates to Interchange Fees for Visa & Mastercard in Canada 🇨🇦\nHoward Spector joins Jane!\nJane Appoints Dan Davidow as Chief Marketing Officer\nJane App's Support Team Wins a Bronze Stevie® Award\nDemo Videos\nPractitioner's Home Base: Day Sheets & Charts\nJane in Action\nPractitioner Training:  Initial Signing In and Overview\nInsurance: Billing a Visit to a 3rd Party\nScheduling: Managing the Schedule with Many Practitioners\nDisciplines, Treatments, & Billing Settings\nSetting up Staff & Scheduling Shifts\nCharting: Signing, Duplicating & Symbols\nScheduling: Complete Schedule Overview\nBilling: Accepting Payments\nLaunching an Insurer Portal\nQuick Start\nStep 1: Clinic Information\nStep 2: Disciplines\nStep 3: Treatments\nStep 4: Staff\nStep 5: Schedule or Diary\nAdditional Set Up Recommendations\nPractitioner Step 1: Practitioner Training\nPractitioner Step 2: Treatments\nPractitioner Step 3: Shifts\nPractitioner Step 4: Online Booking\nPractitioner Step 5: Charting\nAccount Setup Consultations\nSwitching to Jane\nSwitching is easy with Jane on your team\nJane vs. SimplePractice\nAccount Basics\nHow To Check Who's Listed As Account Owner\nChecklist for Starting with Jane\nBrowser Requirements\nDevice & Network Recommendations\nUsing Jane on a Tablet\nUsing Jane on a Smartphone\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nAuto-Logout Duration\nUpdating Your Clinic Email Address & Phone Number\nLog In Help: Username and Password\nEnabling Patient Self Check-in\nAdding a Location\nBooking  a Break on a Mobile Device (Phone or other Small Screen)\nMoving Your Practice to a New Location\nMultiple Locations or Multiple Accounts: How to Set Up Jane for Independent Locations or Practitioners\nAccessibility in Jane\nI Can't Access My Jane Account: A Troubleshooting Guide\nHow to Archive a Treatment, Class or Group Appointment\nBookmarking Your Jane Account for Easy Access\nViewing Protected Financial Documents (For Patients)\nSwitching to the Balance Plan\nAdding a Billing Address for Locations\nUnauthorized Access: What to Do if Your Laptop/Phone is Lost or Stolen\nHow to Archive/Unarchive a Discipline\nHow to Change the Name of Your Clinic\nImporting to Jane\nHow to Import Data to Jane (Overview)\nBasics of Importing to Jane\nDiving Deeper Into Importing to Jane\nWhere Can You Import From?

If you’re a current Jane user, you can find the login information by clicking the\nNeed Help?\nButton in your account. This password is updated every Monday.\nIf you haven’t signed up with Jane just yet, you can find the login password by heading to the\nJane Community Group\non Facebook and clicking the\nFeatured\ntab. You can also request the password by emailing\nsupport@jane.app\n.\nWe always recommend using the demo clinic for testing and practice so that your own account stays nice and tidy. ✨\nModule 2: Claim Submissions & Management\nAlright, now that we’ve gotten through the basics of getting the clinic set up for submitting insurance, it’s time to take a look at actually submitting the claims and the differences between electronic and paper submissions.\nFeel free to scroll through the guide, or hop to a specific section below:\nIntegrated Claims, CMS-1500s & EDI 837ps - What’s the Difference?\nResubmissions & Corrected Claims\nBatch CMS1500 Forms\nClaim Submission Folders\nAll insurance claims are managed under the main “\nBilling\n” tab in Jane.\nThe “\nClaim Submissions\n” area, found on the left, has several folders to keep all patient claims accounted for during the submission process.\nLet’s get to know a few of the Claim Submission Folders:\nThe\nDraft\nfolder is an optional folder used for reviewing claim information. You can set up your account so that all new claims start here. This folder can be helpful if you have dedicated billing staff who need to easily know which claims have been finalized (i.e. all billing codes have been entered) and are ready to be submitted. When your draft claims have been finalized, they can then be moved to the Unsubmitted folder by the practitioner.\nThe\nUnsubmitted\nfolder holds all insurance claims ready to be submitted. This is where you go to submit claims through our Claim.MD integration, or to generate electronic claim files to upload to Office Ally, TriZetto, or Availity.\nThe\nSubmitted\nfolder holds any claims that have been submitted, and are awaiting remittance from the insurance company.\nThe\nApproved\nfolder is your “Done” folder! It holds all claims that have received a claim response and there is no additional outstanding amount from the insurer.\nThe\nWaiting on Primary\nfolder holds any secondary claims that are awaiting primary claims’ adjudication. These secondary claims will automatically move toward your Unsubmitted folder (or Draft if you use this as your review area) once the remittance for any relevant primary has been recorded.\nFor Integrated Claims with Claim.MD customers, the Rejected folder displays claims that have been rejected by Claim.MD or the payer. You can see the rejection reason(s) in the Claim Summary panel.\nCan’t find a claim? Use the\nSearch\nfunction.\nIntegrated Claims, CMS-1500s & EDI 837ps - What’s the Difference?\nIntegrated Claims\nWhen\nintegrated with Claim.MD\n, you can submit claims directly from Jane. No need to download claim files and upload them manually in Claim.MD– Jane is your 1-stop shop here!\nEDI 837p\nElectronic Data Interchange (EDI) is the electronic exchange of business information in a standard format. Simply put, EDI is how different entities send and receive large amounts of data efficiently. These files are used for\nelectronic submission\nthrough clearinghouses, in our case you can submit an EDI created by Jane to these clearinghouses:\nOffice Ally\nClaim.MD\nTriZetto\nAvaility\nCMS-1500\nCMS-1500 is the standard paper claim form used to bill insurance for rendered services and supplies. It provides information about the client, their corresponding insurance policy, and their diagnosis and treatment. This information is the same that’s included in the EDI file, just organized for human eyes to read, as opposed to a computer.\nIf you do choose to go with paper submission, or even if you just need to understand where certain information is populating from in Jane, we’ve created this handy reference sheet for you to use:\nCMS-1500 Reference Sheet\n.\nSubmitting Claims through the Claim.MD Integration\nTo submit claims electronically, let’s head to the\nBilling Tab\nand select the\nUnsubmitted\n(or Draft) folder. From here, select the claims you’d like to submit.\nNext, click\nSubmit Selected Claims\nFrom here, Jane will do a quick health check of these claims to make sure the relevant information is here. If you forget any key pieces of your claim (like CPT codes), Jane will flag the claim for correction:\nOnce your claims are ready to go, you can click\nSubmit X Claims to Claim.MD\nbutton, at the bottom of the page:\nAaaaand, you’re golden 🎉\nThese claims will be sent directly to your\nClaim.MD\naccount for submission, and will be visible there within an hour.\n💡Did you know that, if you’re using Claim.MD, you can also complete eligibility checks right in Jane? Check out our guide on\nEligibility Checks\nfor more.\nNot yet using Claim.MD? Check out\nour guide on Integrated Claims\nalong with some\nfrequently asked questions\n. to learn more and get started.\nGenerating an EDI File for Claim Submission\nIf you’re submitting to Office Ally, Trizetto, or Availity; this is for you 👋\nThe process to generate an EDI for submission is similar to that of integrated claims:\nHead to the main\nBilling\ntab >\nUnsubmitted\nfolder\nSelect the claims you’d like to include in your batch.\nClick the\nSubmit Selected Claims\nbutton at the bottom of your screen and continue to the Pre-Submission Checklist.\nOnce all the fixes are made, then you can\ngenerate your EDI file.\nClick the\nDownload\nbutton in the top right corner. The EDI file includes all of these claims/dates of service, and then upload this file to your clearinghouse account.\nAnd voilà!\nYou can now take this EDI file to your clearinghouse and upload it to complete the submission process.\nAll submitted claims will now be moved from the Unsubmitted folder area, over to the Submitted folder awaiting payment.\nPractice Drill 🏈\nHop on to the Demo Clinic to do this next exercise!\nInstructions:\nHead into the\nBilling\ntab at the top of Jane and then select the\nUnsubmitted\nfolder.\nSelect a claim by clicking on the item, highlighting it blue.\nClick the Submit Selected Claims button at the bottom of your screen and continue to the Pre-Submission Checklist.\nFix any errors (marked by red boxes) that pop up on the submission by clicking\nEdit\nbeneath the notice.\nOnce the claim is ready for submission, continue to\nGenerate Submission for 1 Claim.\nNote that the claim will now be moved to the\nSubmitted Folder\nonce this is done.\nTouchdown! 📣\nResubmissions & Corrected Claims\nIf you need some help resubmitting a corrected claim, either with Jane’s integrated claims or EDI feature, we’ve included this handy guide doc for you here:\nManaging Resubmissions & Corrected Claims\n.\nPro tip: If you’re connected with Integrated Claims, you’ll see rejections come straight into your Rejected folder. You’ll be able to fix up your claims from there for a speedy resubmission process.\nAs always, if you’d like to read further on creating and submitting claims or generating EDI files in Jane, we’ve put together a very handy resource guide you can view in\nStep 5 of our US Insurance Billing Training\n.\nCMS1500 - Health Insurance Claim Form\nJane can generate a CMS1500 form into an editable PDF for paper claim submission, however Jane cannot print claim details directly onto a pre-printed CMS1500 form.\nOnce you have\nArrived\nan appointment and have added in all insurance claim information, you can click the downward arrow next to the “\nPay\n” button and select\nGenerate CMS1500\n:\nFrom the Draft or Unsubmitted folder, you can also generate a CMS1500 form by clicking the right side arrow, and selecting View Purchase. Jane will tell you if there are any missing fields and then generate the form:\nThis form can now be Printed, or edited further if required. For editing, it’s best to Save the form first and then make any needed edits to the downloaded copy.\nThe CMS1500 Forms will print best on blank paper. Some Payers can’t process the claim if it is printed in black and white, so printing in color is generally a good idea.\n📍\nNote: SOF stands for Signature on File. This is an accepted term but feel free to remove this if you are printing and signing.\nNeed a little help figuring out what’s supposed to go into each box (and where that info is coming from in Jane)? Check out\nStart Billing 4: Claim Management & CMS1500 Forms\nor take a look at our guide on\nInsurance claims and the CMS1500\nor our\nCMS1500 Reference Sheet\n.\nBatch CMS1500 Forms\nWant to export multiple CMS1500 forms in one go? If so, check out the following guide:\nGenerating a Batch: CMS1500s\n.\nPractice Drill 🏈\nHop on to the Demo Clinic to do this next exercise!\nInstructions:\nHead into the\nSchedule\ntab and select an appointment on the schedule with insurance attached.\nYou can easily find which appointments have insurance attached by the briefcase icon on their appointment.\nArrive\nthe appointment and select the dropdown menu next to\nPay\nClick\nGenerate CMS1500\nTouchdown! 📣\nExcellent! 🥳 Now that we know how to generate our submissions, let’s head on to\nModule 3: Modifiers, creating a custom billing code, and changing & adding billing codes\n.Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.\n500 - 138 13th Street East, North Vancouver\nBritish Columbia, Canada V7L 0E5\nContact Us\n+1 844-310-JANE (5263)\n+44 808 164 0893\n+61 1 800 940 893\n+1 604-670-JANE (5263)\nseejanerun@janeapp.com\nWant to keep up-to-date with everything that’s new in Jane?
