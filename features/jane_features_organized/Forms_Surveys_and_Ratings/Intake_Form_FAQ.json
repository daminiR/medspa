This tool is very flexible in Jane, and we’ve collected a couple of common questions that might help you as you set up your forms.\nThis is an FAQ page. If you are looking to set up Intake Forms, we’d recommend taking a look at this\npage\n.\nDo patients need an account to fill out an Intake Form?\nCan I have the consent separate from the intake form?\nCan I require patients to fill out the intake form prior to their appointment?\nIs it possible to have the intake form completed before a patient books an appointment?\nIs there an alert when a patient completes the intake form?\nWhere can I find the completed intake form?\nCan I download a patient’s Intake Form?\nWhy did a patient not receive an intake form automtically?\nCan I send insurer-specific intake forms?\nDo Jane’s intake forms auto-save as a patient is filling them out?\nCan I add my cancellation policy to my intake form?\nIs there a time limit for a patient to complete their intake form?\nCan I send an intake form via SMS?\nCan I print intake form or make a PDF from an intake form?\nCan I upload/import Intake Form template into Jane?\nCan I merge duplicate intake forms I created by mistake?\nCan I create intake forms in multiple languages?\nHow can I disable the 24-hour intake form reminder email?\nHow do I archive an intake form?\nHow to delete or edit an Intake Form in Patient Profile?\nCan I move an intake form to another patient’s profile?\nHow to limit intake form access or hide completed intake form from a staff?\nIf the clinic updates an existing intake form, will the clients receive the updated intake form?\nIs the intake form text customizable?\nCan I merge charts or files?\nCan I remove the Email Communication section from my intake forms?\nWhat do the different intake form statuses mean?\nHow can I send a form created from the Templates area of my Staff Profile?\nIf a patient selects the wrong insurer, can I edit it?\n⭐ Do patients need an account to fill out an Intake Form?\nYes, patients will be prompted to sign in or create an account in order to fill out an Intake Form online.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I have the consent separate from the intake form?\nThe consent portion will need to be kept within the intake form. However, you can still create a consent-specific intake form on its own. This is helpful if consents need to be acknowledged, signed off on and properly documented.\nFor more information on this process, you can check out our guide doc on\nUsing Intake Forms for Consent to Treat or Update Forms\n.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I require patients to fill out the intake form prior to their appointment?\nWhile we would hope that all patients would complete their intake form prior to their first appointment, there isn’t a way to make the form itself mandatory.\nHowever, Jane will send out an Intake Form Reminder\n24 hours before their appointment\ntime to help prompt them to complete the form prior to their appointment. Check out our\nIntake Form Reminder Email FAQ\nfor more detailed information.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Is it possible to have the intake form completed before a patient books an appointment?\nNo\n- At the moment, automatic intake forms are tied strictly to appointment bookings and there isn’t a way to have them sent out without one. This is because intake forms are assigned to specific sessions, disciplines, or staff members to be sent out before a patient’s first appointment.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Is there an alert when a patient completes the intake form?\nNo\n- Staff members will not be notified when an intake form is completed. The recommendation here would be to pop into\nChart\ntab within their\nProfile\n:\nor the\nOnline Intake Forms\nwidget for form completion. Completed Intake Forms will have a date and timestamp to the right of the intake form.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Where can I find the completed intake form?\nTo check the status of an intake form, you can head to the\nPatient’s Profile\nand review the\nOnline Intake Forms\nwidget, or under the\nCharts\ntab within their\nProfile\n.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I download a patient’s Intake Form?\nYou can print a patient’s completed Intake Form by heading to the patient’s\nProfile\n, then to the\nOnline Intake Forms\nsection, clicking the “\n…\n” button in the\nAction\ncolumn to the right of the form, and then clicking the\nPrint\nbutton. You can choose to print, or to save as a PDF to download.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Why did a patient not receive an intake form automatically?\nYou may be wondering why a patient did not receive an Intake Form, so we’ve put together this handy\nMy patient didn’t receive their Intake Form: A troubleshooting guide\nto assist you in your investigation.\nPro Tip\n💡:\nHead over to the\nCommunications\ntab of a patient profile to see all communications Jane has sent to them. This is a great area to start investigating what happened with their notifications. Here’s a link to our\nCommunications Log\nguide that goes over this area of their profile in a bit more detail\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I send insurer-specific intake forms?\nWhen setting up how Intake Forms should be sent, you can specify a form to be sent out based on:\nStaff Member\nDiscipline\nSpecific Treatments\nWith this in mind, we’re not able to send which form is sent out based on the insurer type. However, clinics might consider the following two options in this case:\nSend insurer-specific forms\nmanually\nwhen you see a patient has a specific insurer.\nSet up insurer-specific appointment types, so you can utilize the\nSpecific Treatments\ncategory.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Do Jane’s intake forms auto-save as a patient is filling them out?\nWhen a patient is filling out an intake form, the forms are saved when someone moves from one step to another. For example, if someone presses the blue\nNext\nbutton after completing their demographics, this will save their demographics.\nIt’s worth noting that since intake forms are saved when moving between steps, a very comprehensive Questionnaire portion will take time to complete. Patients should complete this in one go to not lose their progress if they navigate away partway through a section.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I add my cancellation policy to my intake form?\nIf you’re using\nJane Payments\nand have set up your form to require a patient to add their credit card when completing this form, then this will automatically be added.\nIf you’re not collecting credit card information in your Intake Forms, then we would recommend adding your Cancellation Policy to the Consents area of your form.\nYou can do this when you’re editing a form (\nSettings\n>\nForms & Surveys\n>\nView Forms\n>\nEdit\n) by navigating to the “Consents” tab. You can add the language you’d like your patients to agree to here:\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Is there a time limit for a patient to complete their intake form?\nWhen a patient is sent a form automatically or manually by a staff member, it will appear in that patient’s profile as a\nPending\nform. The intake form is included within the appointment reminders if the form hasn’t been completed before the appointment in addition to a\nseparate form reminder\n. If, after all of the reminders, the patient still does not complete the form by the time that the appointment happens, it will expire\n1 hour\nafter the appointment end time. These can be prompted again manually, or you can also set up\nthe Resend Form to All New Bookings as of this Date setting\nso that this form will continue to be prompted to the patient, even if they don’t complete it after the first appointment it was prompted for.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I send an intake form via SMS?\nNo\n- Intake Forms can only be sent via email. However, a patient can still complete their intake form on a mobile device from the email they’ve received or by logging into their\nMy Account\nportal.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I print intake form or make a PDF from an intake form?\nWhile Jane doesn’t have a\ndedicated\nfeature to print or save a blank intake form as a PDF, one way you can accomplish this is by\nPreviewing\nyour template and using your browser’s ability to\nprint the page\n.\nYou can head over to your\nSettings\ntab, then scroll down and click on\nForms & Surveys.\nFrom there, you’ll click\nView Forms\non the Intake Form section:\nNext, select\nPreview\non the form you want to print:\nThen on the preview page, you can\nright-click\non the page and choose\nPrint\nto print a hard copy or save it as PDF.\nWhile this isn’t a functionality that the team is currently exploring, we always love to hear feedback on the features in Jane! You can\nshare your feedback here\n.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I upload/import Intake Form Template into Jane?\nNo\n-  We can’t upload/use or import an intake form template that was created outside of Jane as an intake form template (i.e. a PDF, docx or paper copy). With that said, we have a pretty wide range of templates available in our Template Library that you can pick from and customize to make your own!\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I merge duplicate intake forms I created by mistake?\nNo\n- At this time, you cannot merge two intake forms together under the\nSettings\ntab >\nForms & Surveys\narea of your Jane account.\nAs a workaround, you can have two tabs open, and copy over the duplicate information to the primary form. Once all the information that you’d like is consolidated into the primary form, you can go ahead and\narchive\nthe secondary form.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ How can I disable the 24-hour intake form reminder email?\nThere isn’t a direct way to disable this specific notification at this time. As a workaround, you can select\nDo Not Email\nwithin the client or patient’s profile. It’s important to note that this is an overall switch and will disable all notifications from Jane from the moment this setting is changed.\nWe’d love it if you’d add your feedback so we can use it as we think about how to continue building on this feature. You can share your feedback on this feature request post\nhere\n.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I create intake forms in multiple languages?\nCurrently, there can only be one language preference within the Jane account. The questions in the Profile Field are displayed according to your language setting in Jane. But Intake Form\nQuestionnaire & Consent section is completely customizable\n, you could create a copy of the intake form and manually type out your questions/consents in the other language. So, we recommend creating one intake form in your primary language and another one in whatever language you would like.\nSince Jane is web-based, clients could choose to use their browser translation feature to translate into any language they like.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ How do I archive an intake form?\nTo archive an intake form, a user with Full Access can head over to the\nSettings\ntab, then scroll down and click on\nForms & Surveys\n. On the next page that opens up, you’ll want to click on\nView Forms\non the Intake Form section:\nFrom there, you’ll want to click on the\nthree horizontal black dots\nto the right and select\nArchive\nwithin the dropdown menu options.\n🔥\nHot tip:\nAll the archived intake forms will be hidden but you can find them under the\nForms & Surveys\nsection by clicking on\nShow Archived\nbutton.\nIf you’d ever want to reuse these forms, you can simply click on the form and choose\nSave and Unarchive\noption.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ How to delete or edit an Intake Form in Patient Profile?\nEDIT:\nIf a client completes the same intake form within 24 hours, Jane will replace the first form with the second.\nJane would still update the completed form if it was accessed within 24 hours, even if the form was resent manually.\nOnce an Intake form is\nsubmitted/completed\nby the client it cannot be edited or changed outside the 24hrs.\nIn this case, a new intake form can be emailed to the client if they need to update any information. Since it is outside 24 hours, when the same Intake Form is sent to a client, Jane does not override the first completed form but creates an additional saved Intake Form each time the client completes it. Clinics can choose to delete the duplicate completed forms if needed.\nDELETE:\nAny\nCompleted\nor\nIn Progress\nIntake Forms, can be deleted from an individual patient’s profile.\nNOTE\n📍:\nAn Intake Form can only be deleted by the\nAccount Owner\nunless the Intake Form was completed by a staff member. In that case, the authoring staff member can also delete the Intake Form.\nTo delete these forms, you’ll want to head over to the\nPatient Profile\nand then scroll down to the\nOnline Intake forms\nsection, click on the\nthree horizontal black dots\nand select\nDelete Intake Form\nfrom the dropdown menu.\nKeep in mind that this deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.\nAs an added measure, Jane will ask if you’re certain about this change as well. You’ll need to type in the\ncase-sensitive text\nwithin the box before the red\nDelete\nbutton can be selected.\nIf the consent or intake form was sent manually and is\nPending\n, you’ll see\nthree horizontal black dots\nunder the\nAction\ncolumn that will allow you to delete the form. If the form was sent automatically and is\nPending\n, there is a little bit of a workaround that you’ll need to use to get this deleted.\nTo delete the consent or intake form, you’ll first want to bump it into an\nIn Progress\nstate. To do this, you can click on the\nblue Intake form hyperlink\nfrom the\nPatient Profile\n.\nWithin the pop-up window, you’ll want to select the blue\nContinue as a Staff Member\nbutton. This action is what shifts the form into an\nIn Progress\nstate. Now you can go ahead and close the intake form.\nLastly, you can give the page a little refresh and you’ll be able to click on the\nthree horizontal black dots\nto the right of the form to delete it.\nNOTE\n📍:\nOne important thing to note here is that pending intake or consent forms can not be deleted if the patient has an upcoming appointment where the form is required, or the form has a Resend to All New Bookings as of this Date as of this Date set. The form will return to pending once it has been deleted.\nThe pending form will drop off automatically once the upcoming appointment has passed. In the case of the form being required, the patient will either need to complete the form, or the clinic will want to update the Required as of this Date field in the Intake Form’s settings (\nSettings\ntab >\nForms & Surveys\n>\nView Forms\non the\nIntake Form\nsection >\nEdit\n).\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I move an intake form to another patient’s profile?\nYes - you can move an intake from one patient’s profile to a different patient. To do this, from the\nPatient’s Profile\n, you’ll want to scroll down to the\nOnline Intake Forms\nwidget and click on the\nthree horizontal black dots\nto the right of the form. It doesn’t matter which state the intake form is in.\nNote\n📝:\nIf the form is completed by the patient, only the\nAccount Owner\nwill be able to change the patient. If the form is completed by a staff member, you won’t see the option to change the patient.\nNext, you’ll select\nChange Patient\nfrom the\ndropdown\nmenu options. Within the pop-up, type and select the patient this form is intended for.\nJane will ask one final confirmation since this form will not be visible in the My Account area of the patient this form is being reassigned to. Make sure to hit the blue\nSave\nbutton to confirm those changes and you’re all set!\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ How to limit intake form access or hide completed intake forms from a practitioner/clinician/staff?\nCurrently, there isn’t an option to adjust the visibility of the completed intake forms or hide intake paperwork from certain staff members. The Intake Form Questionnaire/chart privacy settings are determined by the Appointment Type settings associated with that Intake Form.\nIf the Intake Form is set to\nall appointments\n: the form/chart is Viewable to Everyone who can access the client’s profile.\nIf the Intake Form is assigned to a\nSpecific Discipline\nwith multiple practitioners: the form/chart is Viewable to Everyone within that discipline who can access the client’s profile.\nIf the Intake Form is assigned to a\nspecific practitioner\n: the form/chart will follow that practitioner’s Default Chart Privacy settings.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ If the clinic updates an existing intake form that was sent to clients already, will the clients receive the updated intake form?\nNO\n- Since the intake forms links have been sent to clients already, the new updated information will not be included.\nEven if the clinic had added a simple text to an intake form or added a new insurance or credit card section, the updated forms have to be resent to clients. This can be done from the\nclient’s profile > online intake forms\nsection.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Is the intake form text customizable?\nYou can format the text under the\nGeneral\nsection of the intake form using the\nMarkdown sheet\nattached.\nIn the\nConsents\narea, you can format content in the\nText\nsections to add lists, bold or italicized sections, links, and more! Just highlight the text you want to format and the options will pop up.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I merge charts or files?\nNo - At this time, there isn’t a way to merge 2 charts or 2 files.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I remove the Email Communication section from my intake forms?\nWhile you can remove the\nNews and Special Promotions\nsection, the\nAppointment Notifications and Reminders\nsection cannot be removed.\nTo update the selection for\nNews and Special Promotions\n, a\nFull Access\nuser can head over to the\nSettings\ntab >\nForms & Surveys\narea >\nView Forms\non the intake form section. Next, click\nEdit\nto the right of the intake form you’d like to update.\nFrom there, you’ll want to click on the\nConsents\ntab and deselect the\nCommunications\noption:\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ What do the different intake form statuses mean?\nPending:\nThe intake form was automatically or manually sent and not opened.\nIn Progress:\nThe patient clicked to open the form or engaged with the intake form link, but the form is not yet completed.\nDate/Time Stamp:\nThe patient completed the intake form at this date and time.\n⭐ How can I send a form created from the Templates area of my Staff Profile?\nChart Templates are perfect for documenting patient visits, but when you need patients to complete and return information to you, our Intake Forms are the way to go!\nTo transition this form so it shows up under intake forms, a\nFull Access\nstaff member can head over to the\nSettings\ntab, click on\nForms & Surveys\n, and from there, click on\nView Forms\nin the\nIntake Form\nsection. Here, you can either create a new form from scratch or edit an existing one.\nClick on the\nQuestionnaires\ntab and on the bottom right, you can click on the\ncube icon\nin the bottom left corner.\nA window will open and you will have the option to ‘Add a Template’ click on this tab and choose the chart template you want to use in your Intake Form.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ If a patient selects the wrong insurer, can I edit it?\nAt the moment, the insurer on the policy cannot be edited once a policy is saved. The recommendation here would be to create a new policy under the correct insurer and then delete the old one.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter.\nWelcome\nWelcome to the Jane Guide\nCode of Conduct\nFeature Requests\nJane's Brand Assets\nAccount Setup Consultations\nWhat's new in Jane?\nWhat's new in Jane Webinar\nJane's Changelog\nJane's Monthly Newsletter\nUpdates to Interchange Fees for Visa & Mastercard in Canada 🇨🇦\nHoward Spector joins Jane!\nJane Appoints Dan Davidow as Chief Marketing Officer\nJane App's Support Team Wins a Bronze Stevie® Award\nDemo Videos\nPractitioner's Home Base: Day Sheets & Charts\nJane in Action\nPractitioner Training:  Initial Signing In and Overview\nInsurance: Billing a Visit to a 3rd Party\nScheduling: Managing the Schedule with Many Practitioners\nDisciplines, Treatments, & Billing Settings\nSetting up Staff & Scheduling Shifts\nCharting: Signing, Duplicating & Symbols\nScheduling: Complete Schedule Overview\nBilling: Accepting Payments\nLaunching an Insurer Portal\nQuick Start\nStep 1: Clinic Information\nStep 2: Disciplines\nStep 3: Treatments\nStep 4: Staff\nStep 5: Schedule or Diary\nAdditional Set Up Recommendations\nPractitioner Step 1: Practitioner Training\nPractitioner Step 2: Treatments\nPractitioner Step 3: Shifts\nPractitioner Step 4: Online Booking\nPractitioner Step 5: Charting\nAccount Setup Consultations\nSwitching to Jane\nSwitching is easy with Jane on your team\nJane vs. SimplePractice\nAccount Basics\nHow To Check Who's Listed As Account Owner\nChecklist for Starting with Jane\nBrowser Requirements\nDevice & Network Recommendations\nUsing Jane on a Tablet\nUsing Jane on a Smartphone\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nAuto-Logout Duration\nUpdating Your Clinic Email Address & Phone Number\nLog In Help: Username and Password\nEnabling Patient Self Check-in\nAdding a Location\nBooking  a Break on a Mobile Device (Phone or other Small Screen)\nMoving Your Practice to a New Location\nMultiple Locations or Multiple Accounts: How to Set Up Jane for Independent Locations or Practitioners\nAccessibility in Jane\nI Can't Access My Jane Account: A Troubleshooting Guide\nHow to Archive a Treatment, Class or Group Appointment\nBookmarking Your Jane Account for Easy Access\nViewing Protected Financial Documents (For Patients)\nSwitching to the Balance Plan\nAdding a Billing Address for Locations\nUnauthorized Access: What to Do if Your Laptop/Phone is Lost or Stolen\nHow to Archive/Unarchive a Discipline\nHow to Change the Name of Your Clinic\nImporting to Jane\nHow to Import Data to Jane (Overview)\nBasics of Importing to Jane\nDiving Deeper Into Importing to Jane\nWhere Can You Import From?

This tool is very flexible in Jane, and we’ve collected a couple of common questions that might help you as you set up your forms.\nThis is an FAQ page. If you are looking to set up Intake Forms, we’d recommend taking a look at this\npage\n.\nDo patients need an account to fill out an Intake Form?\nCan I have the consent separate from the intake form?\nCan I require patients to fill out the intake form prior to their appointment?\nIs it possible to have the intake form completed before a patient books an appointment?\nIs there an alert when a patient completes the intake form?\nWhere can I find the completed intake form?\nCan I download a patient’s Intake Form?\nWhy did a patient not receive an intake form automtically?\nCan I send insurer-specific intake forms?\nDo Jane’s intake forms auto-save as a patient is filling them out?\nCan I add my cancellation policy to my intake form?\nIs there a time limit for a patient to complete their intake form?\nCan I send an intake form via SMS?\nCan I print intake form or make a PDF from an intake form?\nCan I upload/import Intake Form template into Jane?\nCan I merge duplicate intake forms I created by mistake?\nCan I create intake forms in multiple languages?\nHow can I disable the 24-hour intake form reminder email?\nHow do I archive an intake form?\nHow to delete or edit an Intake Form in Patient Profile?\nCan I move an intake form to another patient’s profile?\nHow to limit intake form access or hide completed intake form from a staff?\nIf the clinic updates an existing intake form, will the clients receive the updated intake form?\nIs the intake form text customizable?\nCan I merge charts or files?\nCan I remove the Email Communication section from my intake forms?\nWhat do the different intake form statuses mean?\nHow can I send a form created from the Templates area of my Staff Profile?\nIf a patient selects the wrong insurer, can I edit it?\n⭐ Do patients need an account to fill out an Intake Form?\nYes, patients will be prompted to sign in or create an account in order to fill out an Intake Form online.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I have the consent separate from the intake form?\nThe consent portion will need to be kept within the intake form. However, you can still create a consent-specific intake form on its own. This is helpful if consents need to be acknowledged, signed off on and properly documented.\nFor more information on this process, you can check out our guide doc on\nUsing Intake Forms for Consent to Treat or Update Forms\n.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I require patients to fill out the intake form prior to their appointment?\nWhile we would hope that all patients would complete their intake form prior to their first appointment, there isn’t a way to make the form itself mandatory.\nHowever, Jane will send out an Intake Form Reminder\n24 hours before their appointment\ntime to help prompt them to complete the form prior to their appointment. Check out our\nIntake Form Reminder Email FAQ\nfor more detailed information.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Is it possible to have the intake form completed before a patient books an appointment?\nNo\n- At the moment, automatic intake forms are tied strictly to appointment bookings and there isn’t a way to have them sent out without one. This is because intake forms are assigned to specific sessions, disciplines, or staff members to be sent out before a patient’s first appointment.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Is there an alert when a patient completes the intake form?\nNo\n- Staff members will not be notified when an intake form is completed. The recommendation here would be to pop into\nChart\ntab within their\nProfile\n:\nor the\nOnline Intake Forms\nwidget for form completion. Completed Intake Forms will have a date and timestamp to the right of the intake form.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Where can I find the completed intake form?\nTo check the status of an intake form, you can head to the\nPatient’s Profile\nand review the\nOnline Intake Forms\nwidget, or under the\nCharts\ntab within their\nProfile\n.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I download a patient’s Intake Form?\nYou can print a patient’s completed Intake Form by heading to the patient’s\nProfile\n, then to the\nOnline Intake Forms\nsection, clicking the “\n…\n” button in the\nAction\ncolumn to the right of the form, and then clicking the\nPrint\nbutton. You can choose to print, or to save as a PDF to download.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Why did a patient not receive an intake form automatically?\nYou may be wondering why a patient did not receive an Intake Form, so we’ve put together this handy\nMy patient didn’t receive their Intake Form: A troubleshooting guide\nto assist you in your investigation.\nPro Tip\n💡:\nHead over to the\nCommunications\ntab of a patient profile to see all communications Jane has sent to them. This is a great area to start investigating what happened with their notifications. Here’s a link to our\nCommunications Log\nguide that goes over this area of their profile in a bit more detail\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I send insurer-specific intake forms?\nWhen setting up how Intake Forms should be sent, you can specify a form to be sent out based on:\nStaff Member\nDiscipline\nSpecific Treatments\nWith this in mind, we’re not able to send which form is sent out based on the insurer type. However, clinics might consider the following two options in this case:\nSend insurer-specific forms\nmanually\nwhen you see a patient has a specific insurer.\nSet up insurer-specific appointment types, so you can utilize the\nSpecific Treatments\ncategory.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Do Jane’s intake forms auto-save as a patient is filling them out?\nWhen a patient is filling out an intake form, the forms are saved when someone moves from one step to another. For example, if someone presses the blue\nNext\nbutton after completing their demographics, this will save their demographics.\nIt’s worth noting that since intake forms are saved when moving between steps, a very comprehensive Questionnaire portion will take time to complete. Patients should complete this in one go to not lose their progress if they navigate away partway through a section.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I add my cancellation policy to my intake form?\nIf you’re using\nJane Payments\nand have set up your form to require a patient to add their credit card when completing this form, then this will automatically be added.\nIf you’re not collecting credit card information in your Intake Forms, then we would recommend adding your Cancellation Policy to the Consents area of your form.\nYou can do this when you’re editing a form (\nSettings\n>\nForms & Surveys\n>\nView Forms\n>\nEdit\n) by navigating to the “Consents” tab. You can add the language you’d like your patients to agree to here:\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Is there a time limit for a patient to complete their intake form?\nWhen a patient is sent a form automatically or manually by a staff member, it will appear in that patient’s profile as a\nPending\nform. The intake form is included within the appointment reminders if the form hasn’t been completed before the appointment in addition to a\nseparate form reminder\n. If, after all of the reminders, the patient still does not complete the form by the time that the appointment happens, it will expire\n1 hour\nafter the appointment end time. These can be prompted again manually, or you can also set up\nthe Resend Form to All New Bookings as of this Date setting\nso that this form will continue to be prompted to the patient, even if they don’t complete it after the first appointment it was prompted for.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I send an intake form via SMS?\nNo\n- Intake Forms can only be sent via email. However, a patient can still complete their intake form on a mobile device from the email they’ve received or by logging into their\nMy Account\nportal.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I print intake form or make a PDF from an intake form?\nWhile Jane doesn’t have a\ndedicated\nfeature to print or save a blank intake form as a PDF, one way you can accomplish this is by\nPreviewing\nyour template and using your browser’s ability to\nprint the page\n.\nYou can head over to your\nSettings\ntab, then scroll down and click on\nForms & Surveys.\nFrom there, you’ll click\nView Forms\non the Intake Form section:\nNext, select\nPreview\non the form you want to print:\nThen on the preview page, you can\nright-click\non the page and choose\nPrint\nto print a hard copy or save it as PDF.\nWhile this isn’t a functionality that the team is currently exploring, we always love to hear feedback on the features in Jane! You can\nshare your feedback here\n.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I upload/import Intake Form Template into Jane?\nNo\n-  We can’t upload/use or import an intake form template that was created outside of Jane as an intake form template (i.e. a PDF, docx or paper copy). With that said, we have a pretty wide range of templates available in our Template Library that you can pick from and customize to make your own!\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I merge duplicate intake forms I created by mistake?\nNo\n- At this time, you cannot merge two intake forms together under the\nSettings\ntab >\nForms & Surveys\narea of your Jane account.\nAs a workaround, you can have two tabs open, and copy over the duplicate information to the primary form. Once all the information that you’d like is consolidated into the primary form, you can go ahead and\narchive\nthe secondary form.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ How can I disable the 24-hour intake form reminder email?\nThere isn’t a direct way to disable this specific notification at this time. As a workaround, you can select\nDo Not Email\nwithin the client or patient’s profile. It’s important to note that this is an overall switch and will disable all notifications from Jane from the moment this setting is changed.\nWe’d love it if you’d add your feedback so we can use it as we think about how to continue building on this feature. You can share your feedback on this feature request post\nhere\n.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I create intake forms in multiple languages?\nCurrently, there can only be one language preference within the Jane account. The questions in the Profile Field are displayed according to your language setting in Jane. But Intake Form\nQuestionnaire & Consent section is completely customizable\n, you could create a copy of the intake form and manually type out your questions/consents in the other language. So, we recommend creating one intake form in your primary language and another one in whatever language you would like.\nSince Jane is web-based, clients could choose to use their browser translation feature to translate into any language they like.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ How do I archive an intake form?\nTo archive an intake form, a user with Full Access can head over to the\nSettings\ntab, then scroll down and click on\nForms & Surveys\n. On the next page that opens up, you’ll want to click on\nView Forms\non the Intake Form section:\nFrom there, you’ll want to click on the\nthree horizontal black dots\nto the right and select\nArchive\nwithin the dropdown menu options.\n🔥\nHot tip:\nAll the archived intake forms will be hidden but you can find them under the\nForms & Surveys\nsection by clicking on\nShow Archived\nbutton.\nIf you’d ever want to reuse these forms, you can simply click on the form and choose\nSave and Unarchive\noption.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ How to delete or edit an Intake Form in Patient Profile?\nEDIT:\nIf a client completes the same intake form within 24 hours, Jane will replace the first form with the second.\nJane would still update the completed form if it was accessed within 24 hours, even if the form was resent manually.\nOnce an Intake form is\nsubmitted/completed\nby the client it cannot be edited or changed outside the 24hrs.\nIn this case, a new intake form can be emailed to the client if they need to update any information. Since it is outside 24 hours, when the same Intake Form is sent to a client, Jane does not override the first completed form but creates an additional saved Intake Form each time the client completes it. Clinics can choose to delete the duplicate completed forms if needed.\nDELETE:\nAny\nCompleted\nor\nIn Progress\nIntake Forms, can be deleted from an individual patient’s profile.\nNOTE\n📍:\nAn Intake Form can only be deleted by the\nAccount Owner\nunless the Intake Form was completed by a staff member. In that case, the authoring staff member can also delete the Intake Form.\nTo delete these forms, you’ll want to head over to the\nPatient Profile\nand then scroll down to the\nOnline Intake forms\nsection, click on the\nthree horizontal black dots\nand select\nDelete Intake Form\nfrom the dropdown menu.\nKeep in mind that this deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.\nAs an added measure, Jane will ask if you’re certain about this change as well. You’ll need to type in the\ncase-sensitive text\nwithin the box before the red\nDelete\nbutton can be selected.\nIf the consent or intake form was sent manually and is\nPending\n, you’ll see\nthree horizontal black dots\nunder the\nAction\ncolumn that will allow you to delete the form. If the form was sent automatically and is\nPending\n, there is a little bit of a workaround that you’ll need to use to get this deleted.\nTo delete the consent or intake form, you’ll first want to bump it into an\nIn Progress\nstate. To do this, you can click on the\nblue Intake form hyperlink\nfrom the\nPatient Profile\n.\nWithin the pop-up window, you’ll want to select the blue\nContinue as a Staff Member\nbutton. This action is what shifts the form into an\nIn Progress\nstate. Now you can go ahead and close the intake form.\nLastly, you can give the page a little refresh and you’ll be able to click on the\nthree horizontal black dots\nto the right of the form to delete it.\nNOTE\n📍:\nOne important thing to note here is that pending intake or consent forms can not be deleted if the patient has an upcoming appointment where the form is required, or the form has a Resend to All New Bookings as of this Date as of this Date set. The form will return to pending once it has been deleted.\nThe pending form will drop off automatically once the upcoming appointment has passed. In the case of the form being required, the patient will either need to complete the form, or the clinic will want to update the Required as of this Date field in the Intake Form’s settings (\nSettings\ntab >\nForms & Surveys\n>\nView Forms\non the\nIntake Form\nsection >\nEdit\n).\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I move an intake form to another patient’s profile?\nYes - you can move an intake from one patient’s profile to a different patient. To do this, from the\nPatient’s Profile\n, you’ll want to scroll down to the\nOnline Intake Forms\nwidget and click on the\nthree horizontal black dots\nto the right of the form. It doesn’t matter which state the intake form is in.\nNote\n📝:\nIf the form is completed by the patient, only the\nAccount Owner\nwill be able to change the patient. If the form is completed by a staff member, you won’t see the option to change the patient.\nNext, you’ll select\nChange Patient\nfrom the\ndropdown\nmenu options. Within the pop-up, type and select the patient this form is intended for.\nJane will ask one final confirmation since this form will not be visible in the My Account area of the patient this form is being reassigned to. Make sure to hit the blue\nSave\nbutton to confirm those changes and you’re all set!\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ How to limit intake form access or hide completed intake forms from a practitioner/clinician/staff?\nCurrently, there isn’t an option to adjust the visibility of the completed intake forms or hide intake paperwork from certain staff members. The Intake Form Questionnaire/chart privacy settings are determined by the Appointment Type settings associated with that Intake Form.\nIf the Intake Form is set to\nall appointments\n: the form/chart is Viewable to Everyone who can access the client’s profile.\nIf the Intake Form is assigned to a\nSpecific Discipline\nwith multiple practitioners: the form/chart is Viewable to Everyone within that discipline who can access the client’s profile.\nIf the Intake Form is assigned to a\nspecific practitioner\n: the form/chart will follow that practitioner’s Default Chart Privacy settings.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ If the clinic updates an existing intake form that was sent to clients already, will the clients receive the updated intake form?\nNO\n- Since the intake forms links have been sent to clients already, the new updated information will not be included.\nEven if the clinic had added a simple text to an intake form or added a new insurance or credit card section, the updated forms have to be resent to clients. This can be done from the\nclient’s profile > online intake forms\nsection.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Is the intake form text customizable?\nYou can format the text under the\nGeneral\nsection of the intake form using the\nMarkdown sheet\nattached.\nIn the\nConsents\narea, you can format content in the\nText\nsections to add lists, bold or italicized sections, links, and more! Just highlight the text you want to format and the options will pop up.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I merge charts or files?\nNo - At this time, there isn’t a way to merge 2 charts or 2 files.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I remove the Email Communication section from my intake forms?\nWhile you can remove the\nNews and Special Promotions\nsection, the\nAppointment Notifications and Reminders\nsection cannot be removed.\nTo update the selection for\nNews and Special Promotions\n, a\nFull Access\nuser can head over to the\nSettings\ntab >\nForms & Surveys\narea >\nView Forms\non the intake form section. Next, click\nEdit\nto the right of the intake form you’d like to update.\nFrom there, you’ll want to click on the\nConsents\ntab and deselect the\nCommunications\noption:\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ What do the different intake form statuses mean?\nPending:\nThe intake form was automatically or manually sent and not opened.\nIn Progress:\nThe patient clicked to open the form or engaged with the intake form link, but the form is not yet completed.\nDate/Time Stamp:\nThe patient completed the intake form at this date and time.\n⭐ How can I send a form created from the Templates area of my Staff Profile?\nChart Templates are perfect for documenting patient visits, but when you need patients to complete and return information to you, our Intake Forms are the way to go!\nTo transition this form so it shows up under intake forms, a\nFull Access\nstaff member can head over to the\nSettings\ntab, click on\nForms & Surveys\n, and from there, click on\nView Forms\nin the\nIntake Form\nsection. Here, you can either create a new form from scratch or edit an existing one.\nClick on the\nQuestionnaires\ntab and on the bottom right, you can click on the\ncube icon\nin the bottom left corner.\nA window will open and you will have the option to ‘Add a Template’ click on this tab and choose the chart template you want to use in your Intake Form.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ If a patient selects the wrong insurer, can I edit it?\nAt the moment, the insurer on the policy cannot be edited once a policy is saved. The recommendation here would be to create a new policy under the correct insurer and then delete the old one.\n🔝\nSkip back to topSubscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.\n500 - 138 13th Street East, North Vancouver\nBritish Columbia, Canada V7L 0E5\nContact Us\n+1 844-310-JANE (5263)\n+44 808 164 0893\n+61 1 800 940 893\n+1 604-670-JANE (5263)\nseejanerun@janeapp.com\nWant to keep up-to-date with everything that’s new in Jane?
