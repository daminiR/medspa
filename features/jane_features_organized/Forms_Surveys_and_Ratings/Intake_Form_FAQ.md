Intake forms are a great tool for collecting key information from your patients. This tool is very flexible in Jane, and we’ve collected a couple of common questions that might help you as you set up your forms.
This is an FAQ page. If you are looking to set up Intake Forms, we’d recommend taking a look at this
page
.

⭐ Do patients need an account to fill out an Intake Form?
Yes, patients will be prompted to sign in or create an account in order to fill out an Intake Form online.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I have the consent separate from the intake form?
The consent portion will need to be kept within the intake form. However, you can still create a consent-specific intake form on its own. This is helpful if consents need to be acknowledged, signed off on and properly documented.
For more information on this process, you can check out our guide doc on
Using Intake Forms for Consent to Treat or Update Forms
.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I require patients to fill out the intake form prior to their appointment?
While we would hope that all patients would complete their intake form prior to their first appointment, there isn’t a way to make the form itself mandatory.
However, Jane will send out an Intake Form Reminder
24 hours before their appointment
time to help prompt them to complete the form prior to their appointment. Check out our
Intake Form Reminder Email FAQ
for more detailed information.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Is it possible to have the intake form completed before a patient books an appointment?
No
- At the moment, automatic intake forms are tied strictly to appointment bookings and there isn’t a way to have them sent out without one. This is because intake forms are assigned to specific sessions, disciplines, or staff members to be sent out before a patient’s first appointment.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Is there an alert when a patient completes the intake form?
No
- Staff members will not be notified when an intake form is completed. The recommendation here would be to pop into
Chart
tab within their
Profile
:
or the
Online Intake Forms
widget for form completion. Completed Intake Forms will have a date and timestamp to the right of the intake form.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Where can I find the completed intake form?
To check the status of an intake form, you can head to the
Patient’s Profile
and review the
Online Intake Forms
widget, or under the
Charts
tab within their
Profile
.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I download a patient’s Intake Form?
You can print a patient’s completed Intake Form by heading to the patient’s
Profile
, then to the
Online Intake Forms
section, clicking the “
…
” button in the
Action
column to the right of the form, and then clicking the
Print
button. You can choose to print, or to save as a PDF to download.

⭐ Why did a patient not receive an intake form automatically?
You may be wondering why a patient did not receive an Intake Form, so we’ve put together this handy
My patient didn’t receive their Intake Form: A troubleshooting guide
to assist you in your investigation.
Pro Tip
💡:
Head over to the
Communications
tab of a patient profile to see all communications Jane has sent to them. This is a great area to start investigating what happened with their notifications. Here’s a link to our
Communications Log
guide that goes over this area of their profile in a bit more detail
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I send insurer-specific intake forms?
When setting up how Intake Forms should be sent, you can specify a form to be sent out based on:
Staff Member
Discipline
Specific Treatments
With this in mind, we’re not able to send which form is sent out based on the insurer type. However, clinics might consider the following two options in this case:
Send insurer-specific forms
manually
when you see a patient has a specific insurer.
Set up insurer-specific appointment types, so you can utilize the
Specific Treatments
category.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Do Jane’s intake forms auto-save as a patient is filling them out?
When a patient is filling out an intake form, the forms are saved when someone moves from one step to another. For example, if someone presses the blue
Next
button after completing their demographics, this will save their demographics.
It’s worth noting that since intake forms are saved when moving between steps, a very comprehensive Questionnaire portion will take time to complete. Patients should complete this in one go to not lose their progress if they navigate away partway through a section.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I add my cancellation policy to my intake form?
If you’re using
Jane Payments
and have set up your form to require a patient to add their credit card when completing this form, then this will automatically be added.
If you’re not collecting credit card information in your Intake Forms, then we would recommend adding your Cancellation Policy to the Consents area of your form.
You can do this when you’re editing a form (
Settings
>
Forms & Surveys
>
View Forms
>
Edit
) by navigating to the “Consents” tab. You can add the language you’d like your patients to agree to here:
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Is there a time limit for a patient to complete their intake form?
When a patient is sent a form automatically or manually by a staff member, it will appear in that patient’s profile as a
Pending
form. The intake form is included within the appointment reminders if the form hasn’t been completed before the appointment in addition to a
separate form reminder
. If, after all of the reminders, the patient still does not complete the form by the time that the appointment happens, it will expire
1 hour
after the appointment end time. These can be prompted again manually, or you can also set up
the Resend Form to All New Bookings as of this Date setting
so that this form will continue to be prompted to the patient, even if they don’t complete it after the first appointment it was prompted for.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I send an intake form via SMS?
No
- Intake Forms can only be sent via email. However, a patient can still complete their intake form on a mobile device from the email they’ve received or by logging into their
My Account
portal.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I print intake form or make a PDF from an intake form?
While Jane doesn’t have a
dedicated
feature to print or save a blank intake form as a PDF, one way you can accomplish this is by
Previewing
your template and using your browser’s ability to
print the page
.
You can head over to your
Settings
tab, then scroll down and click on
Forms & Surveys.
From there, you’ll click
View Forms
on the Intake Form section:
Next, select
Preview
on the form you want to print:
Then on the preview page, you can
right-click
on the page and choose
Print
to print a hard copy or save it as PDF.
While this isn’t a functionality that the team is currently exploring, we always love to hear feedback on the features in Jane! You can
share your feedback here
.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I upload/import Intake Form Template into Jane?
No
-  We can’t upload/use or import an intake form template that was created outside of Jane as an intake form template (i.e. a PDF, docx or paper copy). With that said, we have a pretty wide range of templates available in our Template Library that you can pick from and customize to make your own!
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I merge duplicate intake forms I created by mistake?
No
- At this time, you cannot merge two intake forms together under the
Settings
tab >
Forms & Surveys
area of your Jane account.
As a workaround, you can have two tabs open, and copy over the duplicate information to the primary form. Once all the information that you’d like is consolidated into the primary form, you can go ahead and
archive
the secondary form.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How can I disable the 24-hour intake form reminder email?
There isn’t a direct way to disable this specific notification at this time. As a workaround, you can select
Do Not Email
within the client or patient’s profile. It’s important to note that this is an overall switch and will disable all notifications from Jane from the moment this setting is changed.
We’d love it if you’d add your feedback so we can use it as we think about how to continue building on this feature. You can share your feedback on this feature request post
here
.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I create intake forms in multiple languages?
Currently, there can only be one language preference within the Jane account. The questions in the Profile Field are displayed according to your language setting in Jane. But Intake Form
Questionnaire & Consent section is completely customizable
, you could create a copy of the intake form and manually type out your questions/consents in the other language. So, we recommend creating one intake form in your primary language and another one in whatever language you would like.
Since Jane is web-based, clients could choose to use their browser translation feature to translate into any language they like.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How do I archive an intake form?
To archive an intake form, a user with Full Access can head over to the
Settings
tab, then scroll down and click on
Forms & Surveys
. On the next page that opens up, you’ll want to click on
View Forms
on the Intake Form section:
From there, you’ll want to click on the
three horizontal black dots
to the right and select
Archive
within the dropdown menu options.
🔥
Hot tip:
All the archived intake forms will be hidden but you can find them under the
Forms & Surveys
section by clicking on
Show Archived
button.
If you’d ever want to reuse these forms, you can simply click on the form and choose
Save and Unarchive
option.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How to delete or edit an Intake Form in Patient Profile?
EDIT:
If a client completes the same intake form within 24 hours, Jane will replace the first form with the second.
Jane would still update the completed form if it was accessed within 24 hours, even if the form was resent manually.
Once an Intake form is
submitted/completed
by the client it cannot be edited or changed outside the 24hrs.
In this case, a new intake form can be emailed to the client if they need to update any information. Since it is outside 24 hours, when the same Intake Form is sent to a client, Jane does not override the first completed form but creates an additional saved Intake Form each time the client completes it. Clinics can choose to delete the duplicate completed forms if needed.
DELETE:
Any
Completed
or
In Progress
Intake Forms, can be deleted from an individual patient’s profile.
NOTE
📍:
An Intake Form can only be deleted by the
Account Owner
unless the Intake Form was completed by a staff member. In that case, the authoring staff member can also delete the Intake Form.
To delete these forms, you’ll want to head over to the
Patient Profile
and then scroll down to the
Online Intake forms
section, click on the
three horizontal black dots
and select
Delete Intake Form
from the dropdown menu.
Keep in mind that this deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
As an added measure, Jane will ask if you’re certain about this change as well. You’ll need to type in the
case-sensitive text
within the box before the red
Delete
button can be selected.
If the consent or intake form was sent manually and is
Pending
, you’ll see
three horizontal black dots
under the
Action
column that will allow you to delete the form. If the form was sent automatically and is
Pending
, there is a little bit of a workaround that you’ll need to use to get this deleted.
To delete the consent or intake form, you’ll first want to bump it into an
In Progress
state. To do this, you can click on the
blue Intake form hyperlink
from the
Patient Profile
.
Within the pop-up window, you’ll want to select the blue
Continue as a Staff Member
button. This action is what shifts the form into an
In Progress
state. Now you can go ahead and close the intake form.
Lastly, you can give the page a little refresh and you’ll be able to click on the
three horizontal black dots
to the right of the form to delete it.
NOTE
📍:
One important thing to note here is that pending intake or consent forms can not be deleted if the patient has an upcoming appointment where the form is required, or the form has a Resend to All New Bookings as of this Date as of this Date set. The form will return to pending once it has been deleted.
The pending form will drop off automatically once the upcoming appointment has passed. In the case of the form being required, the patient will either need to complete the form, or the clinic will want to update the Required as of this Date field in the Intake Form’s settings (
Settings
tab >
Forms & Surveys
>
View Forms
on the
Intake Form
section >
Edit
).
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I move an intake form to another patient’s profile?
Yes - you can move an intake from one patient’s profile to a different patient. To do this, from the
Patient’s Profile
, you’ll want to scroll down to the
Online Intake Forms
widget and click on the
three horizontal black dots
to the right of the form. It doesn’t matter which state the intake form is in.
Note
📝:
If the form is completed by the patient, only the
Account Owner
will be able to change the patient. If the form is completed by a staff member, you won’t see the option to change the patient.
Next, you’ll select
Change Patient
from the
dropdown
menu options. Within the pop-up, type and select the patient this form is intended for.
Jane will ask one final confirmation since this form will not be visible in the My Account area of the patient this form is being reassigned to. Make sure to hit the blue
Save
button to confirm those changes and you’re all set!
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How to limit intake form access or hide completed intake forms from a practitioner/clinician/staff?
Currently, there isn’t an option to adjust the visibility of the completed intake forms or hide intake paperwork from certain staff members. The Intake Form Questionnaire/chart privacy settings are determined by the Appointment Type settings associated with that Intake Form.
If the Intake Form is set to
all appointments
: the form/chart is Viewable to Everyone who can access the client’s profile.
If the Intake Form is assigned to a
Specific Discipline
with multiple practitioners: the form/chart is Viewable to Everyone within that discipline who can access the client’s profile.
If the Intake Form is assigned to a
specific practitioner
: the form/chart will follow that practitioner’s Default Chart Privacy settings.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ If the clinic updates an existing intake form that was sent to clients already, will the clients receive the updated intake form?
NO
- Since the intake forms links have been sent to clients already, the new updated information will not be included.
Even if the clinic had added a simple text to an intake form or added a new insurance or credit card section, the updated forms have to be resent to clients. This can be done from the
client’s profile > online intake forms
section.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Is the intake form text customizable?
You can format the text under the
General
section of the intake form using the
Markdown sheet
attached.
In the
Consents
area, you can format content in the
Text
sections to add lists, bold or italicized sections, links, and more! Just highlight the text you want to format and the options will pop up.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I merge charts or files?
No - At this time, there isn’t a way to merge 2 charts or 2 files.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I remove the Email Communication section from my intake forms?
While you can remove the
News and Special Promotions
section, the
Appointment Notifications and Reminders
section cannot be removed.
To update the selection for
News and Special Promotions
, a
Full Access
user can head over to the
Settings
tab >
Forms & Surveys
area >
View Forms
on the intake form section. Next, click
Edit
to the right of the intake form you’d like to update.
From there, you’ll want to click on the
Consents
tab and deselect the
Communications
option:
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ What do the different intake form statuses mean?
Pending:
The intake form was automatically or manually sent and not opened.
In Progress:
The patient clicked to open the form or engaged with the intake form link, but the form is not yet completed.
Date/Time Stamp:
The patient completed the intake form at this date and time.
⭐ How can I send a form created from the Templates area of my Staff Profile?
Chart Templates are perfect for documenting patient visits, but when you need patients to complete and return information to you, our Intake Forms are the way to go!
To transition this form so it shows up under intake forms, a
Full Access
staff member can head over to the
Settings
tab, click on
Forms & Surveys
, and from there, click on
View Forms
in the
Intake Form
section. Here, you can either create a new form from scratch or edit an existing one.
Click on the
Questionnaires
tab and on the bottom right, you can click on the
cube icon
in the bottom left corner.
A window will open and you will have the option to ‘Add a Template’ click on this tab and choose the chart template you want to use in your Intake Form.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ If a patient selects the wrong insurer, can I edit it?
At the moment, the insurer on the policy cannot be edited once a policy is saved. The recommendation here would be to create a new policy under the correct insurer and then delete the old one.

Legacy PlansIntake forms are a great tool for collecting key information from your patients. This tool is very flexible in Jane, and we’ve collected a couple of common questions that might help you as you set up your forms.
This is an FAQ page. If you are looking to set up Intake Forms, we’d recommend taking a look at this
page
.
Do patients need an account to fill out an Intake Form?
Can I have the consent separate from the intake form?
Can I require patients to fill out the intake form prior to their appointment?
Is it possible to have the intake form completed before a patient books an appointment?
Is there an alert when a patient completes the intake form?
Where can I find the completed intake form?
Can I download a patient’s Intake Form?
Why did a patient not receive an intake form automtically?
Can I send insurer-specific intake forms?
Do Jane’s intake forms auto-save as a patient is filling them out?
Can I add my cancellation policy to my intake form?
Is there a time limit for a patient to complete their intake form?
Can I send an intake form via SMS?
Can I print intake form or make a PDF from an intake form?
Can I upload/import Intake Form template into Jane?
Can I merge duplicate intake forms I created by mistake?
Can I create intake forms in multiple languages?
How can I disable the 24-hour intake form reminder email?
How do I archive an intake form?
How to delete or edit an Intake Form in Patient Profile?
Can I move an intake form to another patient’s profile?
How to limit intake form access or hide completed intake form from a staff?
If the clinic updates an existing intake form, will the clients receive the updated intake form?
Is the intake form text customizable?
Can I merge charts or files?
Can I remove the Email Communication section from my intake forms?
What do the different intake form statuses mean?
How can I send a form created from the Templates area of my Staff Profile?
If a patient selects the wrong insurer, can I edit it?
⭐ Do patients need an account to fill out an Intake Form?
Yes, patients will be prompted to sign in or create an account in order to fill out an Intake Form online.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I have the consent separate from the intake form?
The consent portion will need to be kept within the intake form. However, you can still create a consent-specific intake form on its own. This is helpful if consents need to be acknowledged, signed off on and properly documented.
For more information on this process, you can check out our guide doc on
Using Intake Forms for Consent to Treat or Update Forms
.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I require patients to fill out the intake form prior to their appointment?
While we would hope that all patients would complete their intake form prior to their first appointment, there isn’t a way to make the form itself mandatory.
However, Jane will send out an Intake Form Reminder
24 hours before their appointment
time to help prompt them to complete the form prior to their appointment. Check out our
Intake Form Reminder Email FAQ
for more detailed information.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Is it possible to have the intake form completed before a patient books an appointment?
No
- At the moment, automatic intake forms are tied strictly to appointment bookings and there isn’t a way to have them sent out without one. This is because intake forms are assigned to specific sessions, disciplines, or staff members to be sent out before a patient’s first appointment.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Is there an alert when a patient completes the intake form?
No
- Staff members will not be notified when an intake form is completed. The recommendation here would be to pop into
Chart
tab within their
Profile
:
or the
Online Intake Forms
widget for form completion. Completed Intake Forms will have a date and timestamp to the right of the intake form.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Where can I find the completed intake form?
To check the status of an intake form, you can head to the
Patient’s Profile
and review the
Online Intake Forms
widget, or under the
Charts
tab within their
Profile
.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I download a patient’s Intake Form?
You can print a patient’s completed Intake Form by heading to the patient’s
Profile
, then to the
Online Intake Forms
section, clicking the “
…
” button in the
Action
column to the right of the form, and then clicking the
Print
button. You can choose to print, or to save as a PDF to download.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Why did a patient not receive an intake form automatically?
You may be wondering why a patient did not receive an Intake Form, so we’ve put together this handy
My patient didn’t receive their Intake Form: A troubleshooting guide
to assist you in your investigation.
Pro Tip
💡:
Head over to the
Communications
tab of a patient profile to see all communications Jane has sent to them. This is a great area to start investigating what happened with their notifications. Here’s a link to our
Communications Log
guide that goes over this area of their profile in a bit more detail
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I send insurer-specific intake forms?
When setting up how Intake Forms should be sent, you can specify a form to be sent out based on:
Staff Member
Discipline
Specific Treatments
With this in mind, we’re not able to send which form is sent out based on the insurer type. However, clinics might consider the following two options in this case:
Send insurer-specific forms
manually
when you see a patient has a specific insurer.
Set up insurer-specific appointment types, so you can utilize the
Specific Treatments
category.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Do Jane’s intake forms auto-save as a patient is filling them out?
When a patient is filling out an intake form, the forms are saved when someone moves from one step to another. For example, if someone presses the blue
Next
button after completing their demographics, this will save their demographics.
It’s worth noting that since intake forms are saved when moving between steps, a very comprehensive Questionnaire portion will take time to complete. Patients should complete this in one go to not lose their progress if they navigate away partway through a section.
🔝

⭐ Can I add my cancellation policy to my intake form?

and have set up your form to require a patient to add their credit card when completing this form, then this will automatically be added.
If you’re not collecting credit card information in your Intake Forms, then we would recommend adding your Cancellation Policy to the Consents area of your form.
You can do this when you’re editing a form (
Settings
>
Forms & Surveys
>
View Forms
>
Edit
) by navigating to the “Consents” tab. You can add the language you’d like your patients to agree to here:

⭐ Is there a time limit for a patient to complete their intake form?
When a patient is sent a form automatically or manually by a staff member, it will appear in that patient’s profile as a
Pending
form. The intake form is included within the appointment reminders if the form hasn’t been completed before the appointment in addition to a
separate form reminder
. If, after all of the reminders, the patient still does not complete the form by the time that the appointment happens, it will expire
1 hour
after the appointment end time. These can be prompted again manually, or you can also set up
the Resend Form to All New Bookings as of this Date setting
so that this form will continue to be prompted to the patient, even if they don’t complete it after the first appointment it was prompted for.
🔝

⭐ Can I send an intake form via SMS?
No
- Intake Forms can only be sent via email. However, a patient can still complete their intake form on a mobile device from the email they’ve received or by logging into their
My Account
portal.
🔝

⭐ Can I print intake form or make a PDF from an intake form?
While Jane doesn’t have a
dedicated
feature to print or save a blank intake form as a PDF, one way you can accomplish this is by
Previewing
your template and using your browser’s ability to
print the page
.
You can head over to your
Settings
tab, then scroll down and click on
Forms & Surveys.
From there, you’ll click
View Forms
on the Intake Form section:
Next, select
Preview
on the form you want to print:
Then on the preview page, you can
right-click
on the page and choose
Print
to print a hard copy or save it as PDF.
While this isn’t a functionality that the team is currently exploring, we always love to hear feedback on the features in Jane! You can
share your feedback here
.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I upload/import Intake Form Template into Jane?
No
-  We can’t upload/use or import an intake form template that was created outside of Jane as an intake form template (i.e. a PDF, docx or paper copy). With that said, we have a pretty wide range of templates available in our Template Library that you can pick from and customize to make your own!
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I merge duplicate intake forms I created by mistake?
No
- At this time, you cannot merge two intake forms together under the
Settings
tab >
Forms & Surveys
area of your Jane account.
As a workaround, you can have two tabs open, and copy over the duplicate information to the primary form. Once all the information that you’d like is consolidated into the primary form, you can go ahead and
archive
the secondary form.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How can I disable the 24-hour intake form reminder email?
There isn’t a direct way to disable this specific notification at this time. As a workaround, you can select
Do Not Email
within the client or patient’s profile. It’s important to note that this is an overall switch and will disable all notifications from Jane from the moment this setting is changed.
We’d love it if you’d add your feedback so we can use it as we think about how to continue building on this feature. You can share your feedback on this feature request post
here
.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I create intake forms in multiple languages?
Currently, there can only be one language preference within the Jane account. The questions in the Profile Field are displayed according to your language setting in Jane. But Intake Form
Questionnaire & Consent section is completely customizable
, you could create a copy of the intake form and manually type out your questions/consents in the other language. So, we recommend creating one intake form in your primary language and another one in whatever language you would like.
Since Jane is web-based, clients could choose to use their browser translation feature to translate into any language they like.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How do I archive an intake form?
To archive an intake form, a user with Full Access can head over to the
Settings
tab, then scroll down and click on
Forms & Surveys
. On the next page that opens up, you’ll want to click on
View Forms
on the Intake Form section:
From there, you’ll want to click on the
three horizontal black dots
to the right and select
Archive
within the dropdown menu options.
🔥
Hot tip:
All the archived intake forms will be hidden but you can find them under the
Forms & Surveys
section by clicking on
Show Archived
button.
If you’d ever want to reuse these forms, you can simply click on the form and choose
Save and Unarchive
option.

⭐ How to delete or edit an Intake Form in Patient Profile?
EDIT:
If a client completes the same intake form within 24 hours, Jane will replace the first form with the second.
Jane would still update the completed form if it was accessed within 24 hours, even if the form was resent manually.
Once an Intake form is
submitted/completed
by the client it cannot be edited or changed outside the 24hrs.
In this case, a new intake form can be emailed to the client if they need to update any information. Since it is outside 24 hours, when the same Intake Form is sent to a client, Jane does not override the first completed form but creates an additional saved Intake Form each time the client completes it. Clinics can choose to delete the duplicate completed forms if needed.
DELETE:
Any
Completed
or
In Progress
Intake Forms, can be deleted from an individual patient’s profile.
NOTE
📍:
An Intake Form can only be deleted by the
Account Owner
unless the Intake Form was completed by a staff member. In that case, the authoring staff member can also delete the Intake Form.
To delete these forms, you’ll want to head over to the
Patient Profile
and then scroll down to the
Online Intake forms
section, click on the
three horizontal black dots
and select
Delete Intake Form
from the dropdown menu.
Keep in mind that this deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
As an added measure, Jane will ask if you’re certain about this change as well. You’ll need to type in the
case-sensitive text
within the box before the red
Delete
button can be selected.
If the consent or intake form was sent manually and is
Pending
, you’ll see
three horizontal black dots
under the
Action
column that will allow you to delete the form. If the form was sent automatically and is
Pending
, there is a little bit of a workaround that you’ll need to use to get this deleted.
To delete the consent or intake form, you’ll first want to bump it into an
In Progress
state. To do this, you can click on the
blue Intake form hyperlink
from the
Patient Profile
.
Within the pop-up window, you’ll want to select the blue
Continue as a Staff Member
button. This action is what shifts the form into an
In Progress
state. Now you can go ahead and close the intake form.
Lastly, you can give the page a little refresh and you’ll be able to click on the
three horizontal black dots
to the right of the form to delete it.
NOTE
📍:
One important thing to note here is that pending intake or consent forms can not be deleted if the patient has an upcoming appointment where the form is required, or the form has a Resend to All New Bookings as of this Date as of this Date set. The form will return to pending once it has been deleted.
The pending form will drop off automatically once the upcoming appointment has passed. In the case of the form being required, the patient will either need to complete the form, or the clinic will want to update the Required as of this Date field in the Intake Form’s settings (
Settings
tab >
Forms & Surveys
>
View Forms
on the
Intake Form
section >
Edit
).
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I move an intake form to another patient’s profile?
Yes - you can move an intake from one patient’s profile to a different patient. To do this, from the
Patient’s Profile
, you’ll want to scroll down to the
Online Intake Forms
widget and click on the
three horizontal black dots
to the right of the form. It doesn’t matter which state the intake form is in.
Note
📝:
If the form is completed by the patient, only the
Account Owner
will be able to change the patient. If the form is completed by a staff member, you won’t see the option to change the patient.
Next, you’ll select
Change Patient
from the
dropdown
menu options. Within the pop-up, type and select the patient this form is intended for.
Jane will ask one final confirmation since this form will not be visible in the My Account area of the patient this form is being reassigned to. Make sure to hit the blue
Save
button to confirm those changes and you’re all set!

⭐ How to limit intake form access or hide completed intake forms from a practitioner/clinician/staff?
Currently, there isn’t an option to adjust the visibility of the completed intake forms or hide intake paperwork from certain staff members. The Intake Form Questionnaire/chart privacy settings are determined by the Appointment Type settings associated with that Intake Form.
If the Intake Form is set to
all appointments
: the form/chart is Viewable to Everyone who can access the client’s profile.
If the Intake Form is assigned to a
Specific Discipline
with multiple practitioners: the form/chart is Viewable to Everyone within that discipline who can access the client’s profile.
If the Intake Form is assigned to a
specific practitioner
: the form/chart will follow that practitioner’s Default Chart Privacy settings.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ If the clinic updates an existing intake form that was sent to clients already, will the clients receive the updated intake form?
NO
- Since the intake forms links have been sent to clients already, the new updated information will not be included.
Even if the clinic had added a simple text to an intake form or added a new insurance or credit card section, the updated forms have to be resent to clients. This can be done from the
client’s profile > online intake forms
section.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Is the intake form text customizable?
You can format the text under the
General
section of the intake form using the
Markdown sheet
attached.
In the
Consents
area, you can format content in the
Text
sections to add lists, bold or italicized sections, links, and more! Just highlight the text you want to format and the options will pop up.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I merge charts or files?
No - At this time, there isn’t a way to merge 2 charts or 2 files.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I remove the Email Communication section from my intake forms?
While you can remove the
News and Special Promotions
section, the
Appointment Notifications and Reminders
section cannot be removed.
To update the selection for
News and Special Promotions
, a
Full Access
user can head over to the
Settings
tab >
Forms & Surveys
area >
View Forms
on the intake form section. Next, click
Edit
to the right of the intake form you’d like to update.
From there, you’ll want to click on the
Consents
tab and deselect the
Communications
option:
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ What do the different intake form statuses mean?
Pending:
The intake form was automatically or manually sent and not opened.
In Progress:
The patient clicked to open the form or engaged with the intake form link, but the form is not yet completed.
Date/Time Stamp:
The patient completed the intake form at this date and time.
⭐ How can I send a form created from the Templates area of my Staff Profile?
Chart Templates are perfect for documenting patient visits, but when you need patients to complete and return information to you, our Intake Forms are the way to go!
To transition this form so it shows up under intake forms, a
Full Access
staff member can head over to the
Settings
tab, click on
Forms & Surveys
, and from there, click on
View Forms
in the
Intake Form
section. Here, you can either create a new form from scratch or edit an existing one.
Click on the
Questionnaires
tab and on the bottom right, you can click on the
cube icon
in the bottom left corner.
A window will open and you will have the option to ‘Add a Template’ click on this tab and choose the chart template you want to use in your Intake Form.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ If a patient selects the wrong insurer, can I edit it?
At the moment, the insurer on the policy cannot be edited once a policy is saved. The recommendation here would be to create a new policy under the correct insurer and then delete the old one.
