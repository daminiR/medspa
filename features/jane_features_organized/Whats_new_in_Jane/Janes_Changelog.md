Improvements
Intake Forms
:
There’s a new
consent disclaimer
at the beginning of intake forms to help patients understand how their info is saved.
You can now
mass de-select
profile field values in the intake form builder, making it much quicker when creating or editing templates.
Fixes
🇺🇸 Insurance
: Resolved an issue causing
“Not found” errors
when applying payments to invoices.
Intake Forms
:
Fixed an issue where the insurance dropdown wasn’t selectable.

🇺🇸 🇨🇦
Reserve with Google
Patients and clients can now book with you right from their Google search results. 🔍
Jane’s new
Reserve with Google integration
makes it easier for people to find you and schedule an appointment without needing to click through to your website. It’s a quick way to boost your online visibility and bring more patients through your door.
Here’s how it works:
When someone finds your clinic on
Google Search
or
Maps
, they’ll now see a
“Book now”
button.
That button takes them directly to your
Jane online booking site
, making it simple to schedule an appointment in just a few clicks.
You can set this up by connecting your
Google Business Profile
with your
Jane online booking site
.
Improvements
Secure Messaging
: Messages are now saved automatically as drafts in your browser as you work. This means you can step away or accidentally close that tab (oops!) without losing what you wrote. (Psst… drafts don’t carry over between browsers or devices, so stick to the same screen if you’re working on something big!)
Jane Payments
: Patients will now get a
reminder to update expiring credit cards
on file as part of their regular appointment reminders. This should help catch expired cards ahead of time, keeping checkout quick and smooth.
Intake Forms
: We’ve made it easier to
rearrange the consents
in your intake forms. Now, you’ll see a handy little button next to each consent that lets you drag and drop them into the perfect order. Just don’t forget to hit Save after you’re done!
Fixes
Secure Messaging
: Your clinic’s language preferences are now take into account when sending patient email notifications about new messages.
Patient Profile
: We fixed an issue that caused client names to not show up when editing a Group they are part of.
Intake Forms
:
We noticed that uploaded insurance cards weren’t showing up in the right places when multiple forms were submitted at the same time. Now, everything’s where it should be!
If you’ve ever adjusted the Marketing Emails opt-in text for your online booking page, we’ve fixed a temporary issue that prevented that text from carrying over to your intake forms.
To keep things crystal clear for your clients, we’ve added a
new consent disclaimer
at the very beginning of your intake forms. Now your clients will know exactly how and when their information is saved, right from the first step. Transparency for the win! 🎉
Schedule:
We tidied up a small issue that caused your appointments to appear squished over to the side when a note was added to it. Now your appointments won’t feel the squeeze. 🍋
Custom cancellation reasons won’t suddenly switch to “Other Reason” anymore. What you enter is what gets saved.
The location of upcoming appointments weren’t appearing in the My Account ever so briefly. That’s been taken care of, so there’s no more confusion!
🔝

Changelog: June 6, 2025
🇺🇸 Default CPT codes & improved ‘Copy Previous’
For our US clinics, we’ve rolled out two new updates to save you time (and clicks) when you’re billing the same codes over and over.
Here’s what’s new:
CPT Codes by Service:
Set your go-to CPT codes right at the treatment level. They’ll auto-fill when you book, saving you a few extra steps.
Copy Diagnosis Details:
Rebooking a client? You can now copy just the diagnosis or all billing details from a previous visit in a couple of clicks.
Learn more about setting up
Treatment-Specific CPT Codes
and
Re-booking Clients with the Same Insurance Info
in our guides.
Improvements
Secure Messaging (Beta):
You can now delete a message within 5 minutes of sending it, allowing you the time to quickly undo a mistake if needed (phew!).
Online Booking:
We fixed an issue affecting practitioners working across multiple locations, where patients saw empty sections for services not offered at certain locations. Now, your online booking site only shows what’s actually available, making the process clearer for patients. 🎉
Fixes
Intake Forms:
We’ve fixed an issue where patients with access to a related person’s payment card were getting stuck at the Credit Card step. Now, they should be able to submit their forms without trouble!
Bonus
✨ — we have more improvements coming to make this even smoother for patients with relationships enabled!
Phrases:
🇺🇸 Billing codes in Phrases weren’t showing up properly in the selection menu when adding them to your chart notes. We’ve cleaned that up, so now you’ll see your full Phrase exactly as it will appear in your chart entry.
🔝

Changelog: May 23, 2025
🇨🇦 Online Appointments in Jane’s Mobile App for Clients
For our Canadian clinics, Jane’s mobile app has a new update to help your patients and clients connect more easily. In addition to booking, checking, and managing their appointments, patients can now join Online Appointments (Telehealth) directly from the app.
When it’s time, they just tap “Join video call.” One tap, and they’re face-to-face with you. No switching tabs or searching through emails.
Learn more about joining an
Online Appointment in Jane’s mobile app
in our guide.
Improvements
🇬🇧
Healthcode (Beta):
We’ve made it easier to fix errors in batch claims by showing them in a simple, collapsed view. Less scrolling, more fixing! We also gave the View/Submit button in this workflow a little colour upgrade for better visual consistency.
🇬🇧
Localisation:
You’ll notice a new ‘English - UK’ option to select in Clinic Info > Location > Language, Currency & Numbers that ensures your default currency updates to GBP £, that the ‘Schedule’ is now called the ‘Diary,’ and gives you a Monday-Sunday week with a 24-hour clock. Cheers to that!
Fixes
Secure Messaging (Beta):
We’ve fixed up an issue that prevented line breaks (paragraphs) in longer messages from showing up. Beta testers flagged this one, and we’re happy to have it sorted! 🙌
🇺🇸
Eligibility Checks:
We’ve quickly fixed an issue that caused some fields to map incorrectly when sending checks to Claim.MD. No more mismatches!
Intake Forms:
Clicking ‘Load More’ in the online intake forms section of patient profiles wasn’t behaving—it is now!
Supervision:
We learned that when supervisees needed to make amendments on charts they’d created before having a supervisor assigned, they were unnecessarily requiring supervisor sign-off. We’ve fixed that!
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: May 2, 2025
Optional Signature Setting for Supervision
Jane’s Supervision feature now includes an
Optional Signature setting
! If enabled by their supervisor, Supervisees can decide, chart by chart, whether to request a supervisor’s signature or sign and lock the chart themselves.
This update is perfect for:
Clinics where not every note requires review.
Regulatory needs requiring only certain charts to be signed off.
Jurisdictions where some notes (e.g., SOAP) don’t need signatures, but treatment plans or discharge documents do.
Full Access users can enable this setting in supervisee staff profiles.
Learn more about Jane’s Supervision features in our guide.
Improvements:
🆕
Password Strength Checker:
We’re rolling out a new visual aid to help you create stronger passwords! Whether you’re creating or updating your password, this feature provides guidance on password strength but does not block you from using specific passwords if you wish.
Improved Help Chat Experience:
💬 We’ve made it easier to stay connected with Support while navigating your account! When you minimize an ongoing chat with Support, a draggable chat bubble will now appear at the bottom-right corner of your screen, allowing you to quickly resume the conversation. This feature works on most pages, excluding the Settings tab, for now.
Patient-Facing Permissions:
Patients deserve to feel confident about how their information is shared. That’s why we’ve made an update so that if you have relationships enabled for online booking, patients can now view, edit, or disconnect the permissions associated with their profile.
Fixes
Wait List:
The wait list display was looking a little squishy on mobile devices, so we’ve fixed that up and everything lines up nicely again.
Charting:
We’ve fixed an issue where amendment signatures were incorrectly triggering the “edit and re-sign” footer timestamp used in Supervision workflows. We’ve fixed that up so the amendment timestamp hangs out in the chart body for reference.
Intake Forms:
Staff with the right permissions can once again update the assigned patient on intake form submissions—smooth and easy, just like it should be!
No more déjà vu! We’ve fixed the issue where intake forms were showing up as duplicates in the “Online Intake Forms” section of a patient’s profile in some scenarios.
We fixed an issue that was causing the required insurance photo upload fields and the “Add Additional Policy” button on some patient intake forms. All set now!
Patients Preferred Time Zones:
To keep things simple and avoid appointment confusion, we’ve removed
EST
,
GMT
, and
CET
from the patient time zone menu, as these weren’t updating for Daylight Savings Time and were causing some timing hiccups.
We’ve made it easier for patients to find time zones—the list is now sorted alphabetically by city 🌍

New Auto Logout Feature
We’ve added a new layer of security to help keep sensitive information safe when have Jane open on multiple different tabs in your browser.🛡️ This update is especially helpful for those of you that share devices.
Imagine that you’re hard at work, multitasking like the best of them, with 10 tabs open. When you finish and log out of one tab but forget to close the rest, those leftover tabs will automatically redirect to the login screen if someone tries to click on them. This ensures your patient information stays secure and out of the wrong hands.
Because protecting your data isn’t just important—it’s personal and we take privacy, security, and HIPAA compliance very seriously around here. 💙
Automated Balance Reminders (Insurance)
Collecting leftover patient balances after insurance payments just got easier! With
Automated Balance Reminders
, Jane automatically sends payment requests to patients once their insurance claims are approved and there’s a remaining balance. Less hassle, more time saved, and better payment follow-ups!
Here’s what you need to know:
Jane detects when insurance claims are approved and there’s still a patient balance.
Notifications are sent by email, text, or both the morning after claims are settled.
Patients can pay directly through the link in the notification.
Improvements:
Timesheets:
Now you can
print
the Timesheets report! This makes it super simple for clinic owners to stay on top of payroll records and share them with payroll admins or third-party accountants. 🖨️
Changing a Patient to a Contact:
We know it can be confusing when someone in your system isn’t actually a patient. To make things smoother, you can now convert a patient profile into a contact! This means they’ll
no longer appear in your patient list
but will still be saved as part of your records.
Communications Log:
The Messages tab in patient and staff profiles has been renamed to
Communications
. Renaming this section of profiles will better represent what the communications log is for — a chronological log of all emails and SMS sent from Jane.
Patient’s Preferred Time Zones:
Appointment reminders just got a little smarter! Patients will now see their selected time zone in SMS reminders for multiple appointments, making scheduling clear and straightforward.
Improved Online Appointments:
We’ve boosted the quality of telehealth calls to
ensure consistent performance
, no matter your device or internet connection. Plus, you can now
customize your background
! Upload your own, pick from a selection of default options, or use a blur effect to keep the spotlight on participants. 🎥
Quick Quantities
: Save time with Jane’s new Quick Quantity feature! You can now type exact numbers directly into the Quantity section for treatments and products, skipping the endless clicks on those plus/minus buttons. Perfect for high-quantity items like Botox!
Group Appointments in the Jane Mobile App:
🇨🇦 Your clients can now manage
Group Appointments
directly from the Jane Mobile App. Here’s what that means for your clients:
Easily book a group appointment
Add multiple participants
Choose the primary payer
Need to adjust? Reschedule or cancel for just the primary or the whole group as needed!
Intake Forms & Surveys:
We’ve made some thoughtful updates to the
Intake Forms and Surveys Settings and Edit
pages to enhance usability and create a consistent experience for managing archived forms. Here’s what’s new:
The
Duplicate
and
Archive
buttons now live inside an easy-to-use action ellipses menu for a cleaner layout.
A new
filter
at the top of the intake forms page lets you toggle between archived and active forms.
You can now duplicate or archive an intake form directly from its
edit page
via the same action ellipses menu.
Fixes
Intake Forms & Surveys:
We fixed an issue where surveys stayed active past their end date.
Resending an intake form will no longer create duplicate forms in patient profiles.
There were instances where intake form eligibility was causing forms to keep resending, even after completion. That’s been taken care of!
Clinic Finances:
Printing reports using Safari no longer results in a blank page.
We’ve resolved an issue where receipts would show the total payment amount instead of the amount applied to the invoice, which could make it seem like an overpayment occurred. Your receipts should now reflect accurate payment details.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: February 19, 2025
Patient Preferred Time Zone Setting🌐
One size doesn’t always fit all, and we get it. That’s why we’ve added a brand-new setting that lets you enable or disable the
Patient Preferred Time Zone
feature.
Not serving patients or clients in other time zones? We’ve got you. If you don’t need your local time zone displayed on your online booking site—or if your current setup is already working perfectly—you can turn off the Patient’s Preferred Time Zone feature.
Just head to
Settings > Online Booking > Display Preferences
to make the switch.
Optional Secondary Insurance Details on Intake Form
Last year, we made it possible for patients to add multiple insurance policies to intake forms. Super helpful, right? But some clinics said, “Hey, we usually only handle primary claims, and this might confuse patients.”
Thanks to your feedback, we’ve introduced a new update. Now, you can choose whether to gather secondary insurance details on intake forms. Want to keep it simple with just the primary? No problem. Need more? You’re good to go.
Improvements
Intake Forms:
Updated the intake form so the ‘First Name,’ ‘Last Name,’ and ‘Email’ fields are now disabled when filling it out on behalf of another staff member. No more mix-ups!
Fixes
Intake Forms:
We addressed an issue where the intake form pass-to-patient flow wasn’t consistently blurring the background out as expected.
Pacific Blue Cross Integration
🇨🇦
: We’ve tweaked the copy appointment behaviour for PBC claims with multiple claim items to ensure that only the primary claim carries over to future appointments—keeping everything nice and tidy!
Supervision
We sorted out an issue where the “Load More” button wasn’t refreshing properly in the Supervision tab, sometimes making it appear like there were no charts to review.  A little misleading, but all cleared up now! 🚀
We addressed an issue that was causing charts that hadn’t been signed by a supervisor yet to display the locked icon 🔒 on the Day View.
Fixed an issue causing imported chart entries to show incorrectly as “pending review” status, when they should have displayed as “Signed”.
Charting
We fixed an issue that occurred when updating the Medical Alert field. It was making the patient profile pictures and names look off. Everything’s lined up perfectly now!
Scheduling
We fixed an issue where changes to the treatment length of a booked appointment weren’t saving as they should. 💾
We patched up an issue that temporarily caused rescheduled appointments to not trigger waitlist notifications as they should.
We also made sure shorter appointments (like a 10-minute booking within a 15-minute grid space) no longer filled the entire 15-minute grid space.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: January 24, 2025
Timesheets (Beta) Updates
Staff members can now
clock in
at the start of the day and
clock out
when they’re finished, right from the user menu in Jane (top right corner). Once clocked in, an ‘Open’ Timesheet will automatically begin and will close when you clock out. If clocking out slips your mind (we’ve all been there), this can easily be fixed by heading to your
Staff profile > Timesheets.
If your staff work split shifts or take multiple breaks, they can clock in and out as needed throughout the day.
We’ve also given the Timesheets report a little upgrade. Now you can see a detailed breakdown of individual timesheets for all staff members, making it easier for you to run payroll. Bonus? The Timesheets report is now accessible to everyone.
✅
Practitioner and Front Desk staff
can view their own Timesheets report.
✅
Admin and Full Access users
get visibility of everyones Timesheets report.
You can read more about Timesheets here >
Supervision updates
We made a few notable updates to
Supervision
in December. 🎉  While we’re still fine-tuning and adding new updates in the first part of 2025, we’re already seeing the meaningful impact these workflows bring to your practice.
What’s New?
Chart Activity Log
— Every supervisory signature from start to finish is now displayed to help keep a reliable audit trail of chart actions and to simplify billing and compliance.
Updated Reporting
— The
Appointments Report
now reflects all of the new chart states, like Pending Review and Changes Requested, so you have a clear view of the status of all your chart notes. Plus, your Practitioner Dashboards now come with clickable links to charts needing attention, making it so much easier to take action from your Day Sheet.
What’s Next?
Optional Signatures
— Soon, clinics will have the flexibility to decide if certain trainees require sign-off on
all
chart notes or not.
Multiple Supervisors
— Supervision often involves teamwork. We’re introducing the ability for trainees to have multiple supervisors at once.
Read more about Supervision workflows here >
Intake form names included in client emails.
We’ve made it easier for you and your clients to understand which forms they need to complete. When clients receive an email from Jane with a call-to-action to fill out forms,
the specific forms will now be clearly listed in the body of the email.
Improvements:
Insurance policies just got smarter!  We’ve rolled out a nifty update that flags when a policy attached to a visit is closed (a.k.a. no longer active).
Intake Forms:
We’ve relocated the “News & Special Promotions” setting to the
Consents
tab of the Intake Form builder, so you can manage all consent-related settings in one convenient place.
Voice to Chart:
We’ve rolled out an update to make managing session recordings and data even easier! Based on user feedback, we noticed most of you use Voice-to-Chart for less than 60 minutes at a time. To keep things smooth and efficient, we’ve set a cap at 90 minutes per session.
Here’s how it works:
At the 80-minute mark, you’ll get a friendly heads-up. ⏰
Hit 90 minutes? The recording will wrap up automatically.
Don’t worry—you can still start as many sessions as you’d like! Unlimited recordings, just a bit more structure. 😊
Fixes
Intake forms:
When a relative filled out a client’s intake form, Jane would sometimes get mixed up and accidentally give credit to the wrong “author” in the print preview. But don’t worry—Jane’s not playing author roulette anymore!
If a clients email was connected to multiple profiles, they were occasionally being locked out of their in-progress intake forms. We identified and fixed that bug!
We heard the Intake form was doing its best impression of a hamster wheel—stuck in an infinite loading loop when administrative staff clicked it. Don’t worry, we’ve caught that little bug and sent it packing! 🧳
Ratings and Reviews:
Turns out, Ratings and Reviews were trying to score double the attention by showing up twice in your staff dashboard. We gave them a friendly nudge and told them, “Nice try, but once is enough!” 🥸
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: December 10, 2024
Supervision with Feedback Loops!
We’ve added
Feedback Loops to your Supervision workflows
, helping bring even more of your supervision tasks right into Jane, directly inside chart entries. Everything stays in one place—organized, secure, and easy to manage.
Here’s how Feedback Loops can help:
Supervisors can leave feedback (or a little encouragement!) in a new note field at the bottom of a chart entry that’s Pending Review.
Supervisees can check all their charts and feedback in one spot, make updates, and send them back for review and signature.
Keep track of all requested changes to make chart completion smoother than ever.
Read more about how it works here >
It’s live in your account now! Head to
Settings → Supervision
to get started if you haven’t yet. And as always, we’d love to hear what you think! Drop us your
feedback here
. 🌟
Improvements to the Insurance Policy Report
We heard that this report wasn’t as helpful as it could be, so we’ve made a few updates that will help provide better info & easier action.
First & most highly requested, you can now filter for policies that are “
Awaiting Review
” to find any policies submitted by your clients via an intake form. We also added a “
Next Appointment
” column so you can choose to only see the policies of patients with upcoming appointments.
Once you’ve found the policies you’d like to check, you can now
click on the policy directly
from the report (woohoo!) so that you can take any action needed, like checking for missing details, running an eligibility check, or seeing the claims associated with that policy.
You can read more about the report here >
Treatment Add-Ons is now in Open Beta
You might have noticed something new in your account lately –
Treatment Add-Ons
can now be booked
administratively
in all Jane accounts!
Here’s what this first version of Treatment Add-Ons does for your clinic:
Your staff can now easily add services to appointments on behalf of your patients.
Set up, book, and bill for treatments and add-ons all at once.
Patients get simple, consolidated appointment reminders and invoices for add-ons.
You can read more about them here >
Next up, we’re diving into what this will look like for patients booking online. Got thoughts or ideas? We’d love to hear them! Share your feedback using this

Improvements
Client Relationships
: When a client creates a new profile for someone else (like a family member), that person will now get a friendly heads-up email. It’ll include info about permissions and your clinic’s contact info to make it easier for someone to reach out if they have any questions.
Intake Forms
: When Jane sent your client an Intake Form automatically, it was previously set to expire at the start of the appointment. To cover those cases where they just didn’t get around to filling it in, they now have up until an hour after their scheduled appointment to complete it.
Clinical Surveys
: We learned that some clients were submitting multiple responses to their surveys, so we’ve adjusted this so they can only submit once.
Fixes
Appointment Notifications
: We noticed that the appointment date was being hidden on change notification emails, so we cancelled that game of hide and seek.
Timesheets (Beta)
: We found that Jane wasn’t always returning the ‘freshest’ version of the Timesheets report to you as you tabbed through different reports, so we’ve given it a ‘refresh’.
🇺🇸 Insurance:
We fixed an issue that caused late cancellation invoices to be submittable if the late cancellation adjustment was removed.
Exporting the Insurance Policies report with more than 100 entries? No problem, we’ve fixed up a little hiccup that made this harder than it should be.

Changelog: November 22, 2024
Timesheets is in Open Beta
🎉
Introducing
Timesheets
, a new feature designed to make life easier for administrators and clinic owners in Jane. Now, you can log admin working hours and run reports for payable hours—all in one place. Timesheets is designed with admin workflows in mind, so it’s not linked to practitioner schedules or patient appointments. Think of it as a way to track payable hours for admin tasks that aren’t tied to client care.
Here’s what Timesheets can do so far:
🕒 Log admin time worked for current or past dates.
✏️ Add break times and daily notes.
📊 Run Timesheets reports to easily pull payable hours.
Feedback Wanted
We’re just getting started and would love your input on how to make Timesheets even better. Don’t hold back—your feedback helps us improve!

(More) Insurance Info on Intake Forms
Patients can now add up to
3 insurance policies
on their Intake Forms. That means you’ll have their primary and secondary details ready to bill before their first appointment—saving you time (and headaches).
We’ve also tweaked how uploaded insurance card images are managed. Instead of cluttering up the patient’s Files section, the images will now go straight to their Insurance Policy where they’re easier to find at a glance.
👉 And about that change to insurance cards… we heard your feedback on visibility (thank you!) and made updates to ensure the cards are now easier to view with fewer clicks.
We hope these improvements minimize billing time and make getting paid a little smoother.
Improvements
Test Patient:
We’ve added a reset button to the Test Patient feature. Now you can clear out and start fresh whenever you need a clean slate. 🧹
Integrated Outbound Fax:
We’ve made it easier to know exactly what went wrong when a fax can’t be sent. Better error messages = less guesswork. 📠
Insurance Policy Report:
You can now open an insurance policy directly from the Insurance Policy Report with just one click. No extra steps—because who’s got time for that?
Fixes
Intake Forms:
Abracadabra—your action menu for manually sent intake forms has reappeared! No wand required; it’s back and ready for action. We’ve also enhanced the mobile signature component for a sharper look on the go. ✨

Supervision is in open beta
We’ve created Supervisory Relationships in Jane, making it easier for Supervisors to find and sign Supervisees’ chart notes.
Here’s what we have for you so far:
⭐ New roles and permissions for Supervisor and Supervisee
🫂 A Supervisor can oversee multiple Supervisees
🏷️ Supervisors will find a new tab in their Staff profile, making it easy to spot all charts needing their review
🔏 Supervisors will be able to sign off on charts without the need to change chart authorship 📝
🔙 If changes are required, Supervisors
can send the chart back
to a Supervisee in a draft state
What we’re building next:
🔁 We are building a
feedback loop
so you can provide feedback to your Supervisee in Jane — stay tuned for this update!
If you’re interested in giving the beta version of this feature a try, head to
Settings
and look for the snazzy new
BETA
badge beside the new Supervision option.
Improvements
Integrated Outbound Fax
: We’ve added an autocomplete feature so that any contact you’ve successfully faxed will auto-populate the name and fax number once you start typing. We hope this saves you all some time while we work on a bigger fax contact solution.
Approving Insurance Policies
: We’ve improved the workflow for reviewing insurance policies that your clients have submitted via their Intake Forms. Insurance card photos will now live in the Insurance Policy instead of Files. So, when you click Review Policy, you’ll be brought to the View screen of the Insurance Policy to review all the details— including the photo upload— before clicking Edit > Save & Approve. Once you’ve approved it, you’ll remain on the screen so you can finish up any other pieces of your workflow, like running an eligibility check.
Physitrack
: We’ve changed the name that gets sent to Physitrack to the client’s preferred name, if you’ve included one, rather than their legal name. If they don’t have a preferred name in Jane, it will default to their legal name.
My Account
-
Intake Form page
: We’ve made a couple of updates to be a little more accurate about when an Intake Form was updated and by who.
Insurer Invoices
: If you went to Billing > Insurer Invoices and clicked into any of your insurers in the past little while, you may have noticed that Jane was only loading Purchases from the past 30 days. This was to try to make sure Jane was able to pull up the info you needed as quickly as possible. We heard from many of you that you needed this time frame extended a little, though, so Jane will now pull up the past 180 days.
Fixes
Intake Forms
: Briefly, incomplete Intake Forms were showing that the author— which would usually be the patient— was “unknown”. What Jane meant to say was that the form technically didn’t have an author yet, since it hadn’t been completed. We’ve fixed that up so it’s a little bit more helpful now.

Billing new UK accounts in GBP £
This one is for our chums across the pond! 🇬🇧 Until recently, we only had the ability to charge customers in CAD and USD. Now, we’re happy to say we can bill new UK sign-ups in Pounds Sterling (GBP). This means new customers’ monthly bills will always be the same and not subject to exchange rates.
For our current UK customers, you’ll continue to be billed in CAD while we work on a plan to smoothly transition you to GBP. We appreciate you being here despite the somewhat funky monthly billing. 💙
Improvements:
Chart Accessibility Updates
: We heard from a few customers that Jane’s charts were challenging to navigate via screen reader, so we’ve been making updates to improve that experience. Most recently, those have included improving the way Jane presents Side-by-Side Photos and an Options list in the chart.
ICD-10 Codes
: Jane’s ICD-10 Code Set has been refreshed, in keeping with the updates that came into effect October 1st. We’ve added 252 new codes, removed 36 outdated codes, and revised 13 codes.
Fixes
Pass to Patient
: For a minute there, if you clicked Pass to Patient on mobile, Jane wasn’t showing you the button to close the window after submitting an Intake Form. We’ve fixed this up for all of you mobile-first folks should be able to Pass to Patient without pause.

🇺🇸 Insurance Updates
They say— who exactly ‘they’ is, we’re not sure but they sound smart 😉— that good things come in threes, and our Insurance team recently rolled out three helpful updates for our 🇺🇸 insurance billing clinics. Let’s dive in!
1️⃣
Eligibility Check Design:
For those who check eligibility often, we’ve tidied up patients’ insurance policies. We’ve moved the Notes section above the Eligibility History to reduce scrolling. We now display just the last 3 checks by default, with a ‘Show More’ option for extra details.
2️⃣
Recording Manual Payments:
If you manually log insurer payments, we’ve revamped the design to make it clearer when recording your EOBs. The ‘Edit’ button is now “Record EOB,” and we’ve removed the blue color from the ‘Apply’ button to avoid unintended clicks.
3️⃣
Insurance Policies:
To simplify reviewing patient insurance policies labeled “Awaiting Review,” there’s a new filter option. You can find it under Patient Profile > Billing > Insurance Policies and Billing > Insurer Invoices > Insurance Policies.
In future, we plan to bring this filter to the Insurance Policies Report as well, so stay tuned for an update on that!
Resources Improvements
We’ve been working on leveling up Resources, a key player in our advanced scheduling team, as we noticed they weren’t giving it their all. After a pep talk from the coach, we’re seeing Resources getting along better with Group Appointments and Classes. Now, you’ll see that you can:
Choose a resource for classes and group appointments when booking an appointment by simply clicking the schedule, just like with regular appointments.
Edit/Remove a resource from the Appointment Panel.
We hope these small tweaks will make managing Resources for your Group Appointments and Classes a breeze!
Fixes
Physitrack Integration
:
We found that having special characters in patient names was causing an error, but we’ve fixed that now. 🛠️
Charting:
We cracked the case of the missing
Copy to Patient
window that was playing hide and seek when a staff member signed a duplicated group chart entry. 🕵🏻‍♂️
The
Smart Options
chart part was being a bit lazy and forgot to capitalize the first letter of a paragraph when converting to print or PDF view. That’s been taken care of now.
When a chart was signed, Note fields were no longer readable by screen readers tools. We’ve fixed that!
Intake Forms
:
We found out that when copying an intake form with markdown in the consent area, it was deleting the markdown in the new version. Some staff members also had trouble updating the consent area, but we’ve sorted that out now.
We fixed an issue where intake form questionnaires were left out of the intake form template builder. 🛠️
Inactive staff members’ names were showing up as options in the intake form builder for a short while. All sorted now! 🧹

Changelog: August 6th, 2024
Telehealth & Jane Payments
As a little bit of background, our
integrated payment
partner, Stripe, has telehealth listed as a “restricted” service (which is not the same as prohibited). This is pretty standard in the payments industry since telehealth is deemed as ‘higher risk’ for folks selling illegal products or services. And, while that might make sense in the payment processing world, we know it doesn’t for our customers, who are using telehealth to provide care for their communities.
So we’ve been working closely with Stripe to find a solution and
I’m happy to say that Jane users who offer telehealth will no longer have to fill out any additional documentation! 🎉
A quick note about
telemedicine
: Stripe’s terms of service (like most other payment solutions) prohibit the sale of prescription medications, including via a video call. So
if you prescribe and use telehealth
, you may still have your account paused while Stripe requests more information.
If you’re curious if this would apply to your business, please
reach out to our team
to chat. 💙
Improvements
Insurance Billing
: If you’re looking to attach a patient’s insurance from a previous visit to a new appointment, Jane previously only gave you options from the last 3 appointments. Now, you’ll be able to choose from one of the previous 5 appointments, just in case you need to go back a little further to find the right policy.
Setting up Packages
: We noticed that Jane made it a little too easy to accidentally create a package that included only a single treatment. So, we’ve had a little chat with Jane about what ‘package’ means and that shouldn’t happen moving forward.
🇨🇦
TELUS eClaims
: Someone once wrote that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but we think accuracy smells even sweeter, so we’ve changed ‘Equitable Life of Canada’ to ‘Equitable’ to match its rebrand.
🇨🇦
SMS Reminders & Notifications
: We are moving all of our Canadian SMS reminders and notifications over to a single Verified Toll-Free Number to ensure they won’t be flagged or filtered by carriers (
as a result of this new legislation
). If your clients ask why the number changed, this is why!
🔝

Changelog: July 19th, 2024
Receipts in the Patient Portal
Receipt-hunting no more! We’ve made it so patients can easily access and download their receipts through the
patient portal
.
This update is all about making it a breeze for your patients to find receipts for past payments, like you see in the receipts tab in their patient portal, especially come tax time. It saves time for both you and your staff as well, skipping the back-and-forth of phone calls and emails for resending receipts.
Update Go-Forward Cost of Sold Memberships
Updating sold membership amounts used to be a hassle, requiring a call to customer support for cost adjustments.
Now, with our latest update to Memberships, you can update the ongoing cost of sold memberships with just one click - much more efficient!
This change will automatically be reflected in the current billing cycle without affecting any previously invoiced amounts. To ensure transparency, any updates to sold memberships, passes, or packages will also be recorded in the activity log.
2-Step Verification
Account owners can now enforce 2-step verification (2SV) for all practitioners and admins in their Jane account. It’s an all-or-nothing switch, so either everyone will be required to use 2SV or no one will. If you’re not ready to enforce 2SV for everyone yet, practitioners can still choose to enable it individually.
Account owners can also choose a grace period. During this time, practitioners will get a gentle nudge to set up 2SV and they won’t get locked out of their accounts. Once the grace period ends, they’ll need to set up 2SV before accessing their accounts.
Stay secure out there. 🔒
Improvements
Intake Form Consents:
Our Intake Form consents now come with some new formatting options! ✨ These upgrades are designed to help you highlight crucial information, making it simpler for patients to read and understand. You can now:
Bold
,
italicize
, or underline text
Include links to external sources for additional information
Create bullet points or numbered lists
Select from 3 acknowledgment types that best fit your needs
We hope these enhancements will make formatting your consents easier than ever!
Insurer Statements:
We’ve spruced up the design to prevent timeouts when generating Insurer Statements. Previously, hitting ‘Statement’ in
Billing > Insurer Invoices
tried to whip up a statement for all past purchases, which could be a lot if you’ve been with Jane a while. Now, by default, you’ll see your last 30 days of purchases, and default filters pop up right on the page for easy access and clarity.
Email Reminders
: We’ve spruced up our email templates and now, your patients can easily manage their credit cards through their email reminders.
Security Features:
We given
automatic sign out properties
a new home in the new Security page in Settings.
Treatments:
We created a default “Initial Consultation” treatment specifically for new aesthetics clinics to ease your setup and show how you might start to organize your treatments. This is a new experiment to improve activation rates of medical aesthetics clinics.
Fixes
Intake Forms
: We’ve sorted out a situation where archived insurers were sneaking past the bouncers into the intake form party. Your forms should be archived-insurer-free now.
Fullscript
: We fixed a pesky issue that caused Fullscript to throw an error when setting up a new patient.

Eligibility Checks with
Claim.MD
If you are in the U.S. 🇺🇸 you can now make
real-time eligibility checks in Jane
through
our Claim.MD integration
. 🎉
With this new feature, you can run an eligibility check in just a couple of clicks directly within your patient’s insurance policy. Within seconds, you’ll see the results of the check, which you can easily filter to find what you need and refer back to in the future.
If you’re ready to get started, you can grab your API key from your Claim.MD Account Settings, and head to
Settings > Integrations > Clearinghouse
in Jane. If you haven’t gotten started with Claim.MD yet, we have a few
helpful resources here
.
We hope this helps you collect patient responsibility, reduce rejections, and improve your overall cash flow.
Counsellors added to TELUS eClaims 🇨🇦
If you’re a counsellor in Canada, you can likely now
direct bill through Jane’s TELUS eClaims integration!
🎉
TELUS has recently added more designations to its platform — meaning that counsellors who are members of eligible colleges and associations can now sign up and use the eClaims integration to offer direct billing for their clients.
Direct billing through eClaims lets you leave your sessions on a healing note, rather than a transactional one — so ensure you’re set up with
Jane’s insurance features
if you’re not already!

Improvements
Insurance Policy Visit Tracking Improvement
We’ve given our insurance policy tracker an updated lesson in counting!  Before, our system counted no-shows, late cancellations, and product sales in with your treatments, making the visit count a bit unreliable. Now, only completed appointments (yep, the ones your clients actually show up for) will count towards their treatment tally. This means the numbers will match up more closely with your insurance guidelines. Win-win!
Fixes
Test Patient:
Our new test patient,
Ted Test
, was attempting to play hide-and-seek in the patient list, so we made it so his Test Patient badge was showing up consistently. Now, you’ll always know where he is.
Integrations:
Physitrack had a little hiccup creating duplicate chart drafts while assigning a program - we encouraged Physitrack to drink some water, and that hiccup is all gone now.
Intake Forms:
Some Intake form questionnaire submissions were being displayed in the incorrect order. We’ve fixed that up so now those submissions will display as they should.
🇨🇦
Insurance
: We were hearing some reports of an issue that was preventing the claim submission status from updating at the top of the appointment panel for TELUS eClaims and Pacific Blue Cross PROVIDERnet integrated claim submissions, this has been resolved.
🇺🇸
Insurance
: We also took care of an issue where the US insurance Remittance folder count wasn’t updating after a remittance was fully reviewed.

Changelog: May 29th, 2024
SMS Appointment Reminder Changes for New Clients
Previously, SMS appointment reminders could be enabled for clients by default in Jane. However, as of May 21, new clients must consent to receive SMS reminders to keep your clinic communications in line with changing telecommunication regulations. They can choose this in their preferences when booking in for the first time, in their “My Account” space,  or be opted-in administratively by you. (Tip: include this step in your new client checklist.✅) Canadian clinics may also notice SMS reminders coming from a new toll-free number.
Conveniently, there will be no changes to SMS appointment reminders for existing clients or to email reminders.
Accessibility Improvements
We have been working hard in many areas in Jane to be more accessible to all our users and have been tackling some updates that will improve the experience for folks who have limited vision and rely on assistance from tools such as screen readers.
We’ve learned that long drop-down menus can be problematic, as screen readers read out each item within the drop-down, making it inefficient to navigate things like forms and settings. So, we’ve made a couple of behind-the-scenes improvements by turning those into “text” fields:
Intake Forms:
The
pronoun fields
in intake form submissions no longer offer dropdown suggestions, instead, they now feature a free text input.
Clinical Survey Settings:
Similarly, we’ve also removed the (very long) dropdown menu within the question, “How many occurrences?”, which can now be freely typed into the field
“For how many appointments?”
.
Improvements
Charting
:
We’ve added a new step asking you to confirm before resetting a chart part so that you don’t end up accidentally removing or losing any of the work you have done. Nobody likes to work twice as hard for nothing!
Intake Forms
:
Some of you noticed that trying to add insurance collection to your intake forms before you had set up your insurers was causing a problem. We’ve added a reminder to the Intake Form setup process that will prompt you to create Insurers before entering insurance info.
Fixes
Intake Forms:
We’ve fixed an issue with some of the
required fields
that was stopping folks from moving on from the profile section. Should be smooth sailing again from here. ⛵
We had a few reports from a handful of you letting us know that sometimes forms were skipping the questionnaire and insurance steps - and that just won’t do - that’s been all fixed up now.
Charting:
We learned of an issue that was preventing touch-enabled Windows users from drawing on Sketch and Spine parts. That’s been taken care of so you go back to your works of art.
Integrations:
We fixed an issue where linking a suggested patient in the
Physitrack Integration
didn’t refresh the page, instead, it showed a success message but then returned to the “create/link” page. That’s been all tidied up now.

Changelog: May 8th, 2024
🇺🇸 New Filter in Claim Submissions Folder
For our US customers, you’ll now be able to run a better pre-flight check to look for claims without signed chart notes before billing it! We’ve added a new filter to the claim submission folders to make it really easy to identify claims with and without signed notes.
Treatment Plans
Staff members without Access Billing permissions can now access Treatment Plans!  Now when you head into a patient chart, you’ll see the
New Treatment Plan
button. 🥳
To learn more about how to use Treatment Plans, check out our guide with a new tutorial video to watch along with.
Improvements
Wait List Notifications
:
We heard that patients sometimes found the wait list emails confusing, leading to frustration when they assumed appointments were auto-booked, when in fact they needed to take action. We don’t blame them! So, we made a few tweaks to the email to hopefully clear up that confusion.
Calendar Subscription Update
:
We’ve added a new setting that lets you choose to exclude appointment notes (not charts) from syncing over to your calendar outside of Jane. Plus, decide how you want your patients’ names displayed - full names or just initials!
Intake Forms
:
We’ve added a helpful ’Return to Forms & Surveys’ navigation button to the Intake Form & Survey builder page for those times when you just need to take a step back.
Translation:
We’ve added a new currency translation for our clinics in Vietnam 🇻🇳
Fixes
Charting:
We made some tweaks to the chart entries for better accessibility and ended up with a distracting focus outline on chart parts. We fixed it up now, so no more distractions!
We know that not every chart part necessarily needs a label. We recently made a tweak that caused an unwanted default label to pop up, but no worries - we’ve sorted that out!
We’ve tackled a few rogue issues that were cutting short the temperature details and leaving stray punctuation in the spine chart part notes when pinned to the top of a chart.

Insurance
:
We spotted that the
Copy Previous
options on the Appointment Panel were popping up unnecessarily at times, such as when there was no billing info to copy from a past appointment. Goodbye to those unnecessary actions! 👋🏻
We found a tiny hiccup that was requiring patients to add their middle name when sharing insurance info on the intake form. That’s been fixed and is totally optional now! 😊
Charting
:
We’ve sorted out two issues with uploaded files in a patient’s profile. One was making files sometimes not update automatically in the chart when edited in the
Files

Treatment Plans Report
Introducing the latest enhancement to Treatment Plans — an insightful report! 📊 Now, you may see all of your patient plans in one place, giving you a greater view of your caseload. The report helps to identify which patients are active with open treatment plans so you can stay proactive in ensuring patients adhere to their plans.
To check it out, head to
Reports
and look for the new
Care
category. You’ll see the report broken down by
Plan Status, Visits, Diagnosis
and key
Appointment
dates.
You’ll also be able to filter the report by
Diagnosis,
Plan Status
and
Staff Member
(who created the plan).
Note
: If you don’t see Treatment Plans in your account, you are likely on Jane’s Base Plan subscription. This feature is supported by built-in diagnosis codes that are currently accessible from the Insurance Plan.
New Email Preference Display
We recognized that when looking at a patient profile, it wasn’t always clear if a patient is meant to receive emails from your clinic or not. We wanted to help demystify this so we’ve reorganized this section with some new headings and icons.
Now, you can see which emails your patients are opted in for under clear headings in their profile:
🔔 Email Notifications - for appointment confirmations and reminders
📢 Marketing Emails
⚙️ All Email Settings -  a master switch that allows you to choose whether your patients should be emailed anything or not. Under this header, you may see ‘Do Not Email’ or ‘Emails Allowed’, depending on what you have chosen for your patient.
If you’ve chosen ‘Do Not Email’ for any patients, Jane will now show a new ⚠️ icon next to other email categories indicating that those emails won’t be sent to your patients.
Heads Up: SMS Updates for Reminders and Notifications
Texting
all Jane clinics!  To keep you on top of clinic-to-patient communication regulations, we have some updates to SMS reminders and notifications coming down the pipeline in mid-March.
You won’t experience disruptions to any SMS notifications previously set up, but there are some subtle patient communication changes that we want to give you a heads-up about.
Shortly you’ll see:
SMS appointment reminders will be coming from a new (toll-free) number for our Canadian clinics and their patients 🇨🇦
Patients will be asked to opt in to receive SMS reminders during their setup when they join a new clinic. (This is a simple, one-click action that fits naturally into their setup.)
The SMS “subscribe by default” behaviour will change to ensure patients choose to receive these SMS reminders first.
Reach out to us if you have any questions about staying compliant with SMS regulations

We’ve updated the way you can copy previous insurance information to a scheduled appointment with a new Copy Previous button! Now, you’ll see the new button right on the appointment panel, rather than having to look for it within the ‘Add Policy’ dropdown where it was previously located.
We hope that this small change (and one less click) will make it just that little bit easier to add these details to an appointment.
Fixes
Chart Templates:
We fixed an issue that was happening if you shared a chart template to the Template Library with custom images in it. At times, these images weren’t uploaded properly causing them to be unavailable when clinics downloaded the template.
Schedule:
Jane had a minor case of the hiccups — specifically some niche Scheduling hiccups— that luckily only impacted a few people. But, a few is a few too many, so we held our breath and yelled, “boo” at each other (aka our developers worked very hard) until the hiccups stopped. 👻
Translations:
We fixed up some awkward english phrasing in Welcome Emails for our German clinics. 🇩🇪
We’ve adjusted the Appointment Reminder phrasing in French to be more clear. 🇫🇷
Lastly, we noticed that the way we were translating the ‘Other Referral’ option in Danish wasn’t quite right, so that’s been tidied up. 🇩🇰

Multiple Diagnosis Codes in Treatment Plans
We’re pleased to bring you the first update to Treatment Plans since its release in late November! We heard loud and clear that you’d like to have more than just a single primary diagnosis code recorded in a patient’s plan, so now you can add up to three. 🎉
Once added, you can drag and drop your codes into whichever order you’d like.
We hope this helps you to track your patients’ secondary and tertiary diagnoses, and gives you greater visibility of them at a glance in their charts.
Improvements
Online Appointments (Telehealth)
: There’s been a behind-the-scenes update that we’re hoping makes some improvements in the quality of your calls. We expect call quality and stability improvements to continue with this update—and have many more to come.
We’d love to hear if you’ve noticed better call quality since this update on January 29th. Let us know by
rating your call
at the end of every online appointment. 💙
🇬🇧
Healthcode Batch Upload Tool (beta)
: For our clinics in the United Kingdom, we have made two recent updates to make submissions easier.
For AXA submissions, you won’t be required to enter the injury date to get through pre-submission validation any longer.
For BUPA, claims can now be submitted using professional numbers of any length. 🔢
Jane Payments
: Our clinics in Thailand are now able to sign up with Jane Payments to start getting paid more easily. 🇹🇭
Fixes
Schedule
: This week, a Chrome update caused some surprising blank spaces to appear on some of your schedules. We quickly found a way to fix that and bring colour (aka joy and cheer) back. 🌈
New Patient Sign-Up
: We learned recently of an issue that was preventing new patients from sharing how they heard about your clinic when selecting “Other” during the sign-up flow. This has been fixed and you’ll be seeing those lovely details again.
🇺🇸 Insurance
: We noticed an error that was preventing
past insurer payments
from appearing automatically in the Insurer Invoices folder unless you pressed ‘load more’ repeatedly. Let’s get back to working smarter, not harder shall we? 💪🏻
Charting
:
We’ve fixed up an issue that caused the
vitals and optical chart parts
to not display text content when pinned 📌 in a patient’s chart.
We also took care of an issue affecting Full Access users when exporting their list of
Phrases
. Instead of receiving a list of all Phrases from the clinic, they’ll just get their own now as intended.

Jane Guide Sidekick (beta)
We are always aiming to help our helpers, and part of that is making sure that you have resources available at your fingertips. The next time you pop into the
Need Help?
menu in your Jane account, you will be greeted by your new Jane Guide Sidekick 👋🏻 — an AI-powered assistant that helps you get the answers you need when you need them.
You have the option to “search” and your Sidekick will pull up relevant guides for you. You may also “ask a question,” and the AI assistant will guide you to a chatbot that reads Jane’s guides and gives you a brief answer with a cited source.
We hope that you find this to be a helpful complement to Jane’s support options, especially for those times when you need a quick gut check or answer to a Jane question.
Improvements
2-Step Verification
:
As you know, If you have 2-Step Verification (2SV) enabled, Jane gives you the option to “remember this device for 30 days” when signing in as an extra layer of security, but for those clinics that have multiple users signing in on a shared device, you were being asked to verify yourselves for each sign in. Now, we store 2SV preferences on both the user
and
device level so you won’t be retrieving 6-digit codes to infinity. ♾️
Deactivating Staff Members
:
We heard you loud and clear that deactivating a staff member’s profile could be tedious and time-consuming when their schedule was loaded with personal breaks. So we did something about it and now, once you have rescheduled or removed any appointments, Jane will now ignore those breaks and give you some time back in your day. ✨
🇺🇸 Claim Submissions
:
We’ve upgraded the Insurers filter in the claim submission folders so that you can select multiple insurers now instead of just one at a time. Happy multi-selecting! ☑️
Fixes
Charts
:
We learned that images that had been uploaded to a
Sketch
chart part wouldn’t show up in Print/PDF exports if they hadn’t been marked up in any way, so our team went to the drawing board to get that fixed. 🧑🏻‍🎨
While we were at it, we fixed an issue that prevented the
Spine
chart part title from appearing in printed charts.
Intake Forms
:
We tackled an issue that was causing the intake form questionnaire to create numerous individual entries in a patient chart instead of just one.
We also learned that intake form notification emails were not always being sent to profiles with a relationship that was set up to receive them. That’s been fixed!
You may have encountered a challenge on a mobile device or tablet when trying to add a template to your intake form questionnaire by using the ‘Add Item’ button. That’s been resolved.
We found an issue that was causing an intake form’s Appointment Type setting to reset when the form was being updated causing it to be sent out to appointment types it wasn’t intended for. This has been fixed!

Changelog: January 15th, 2024
Collecting Outstanding Balances
ICYMI, last month we added some new filtering and sorting options to the
Accounts Receivable Report
to help you collect outstanding balances.
With these additions, you can now:
Filter by Insurer or Patient Account
Sort by Name, Amount Owing, and Age of the outstanding balance by clicking on the column headings
From the Purchases tab of your Patient or Insurer Billing screen, you can also:
Filter for All Private Outstanding & All Claims Outstanding using the Status drop-down
Filter by Invoice Age
Best of all, when you click into an Account from the AR Report, Jane will automatically apply those filters so you only see the invoices contributing to the account’s outstanding balance. 🎉
Improvements
Translation:
For clinics in Switzerland 🇨🇭, we have added two new language locale options, providing you the option of using either German or French for your Jane account and all client-facing communication.
Settings Search:
Did you know that you can search for keywords in the settings area to more quickly find what you need? 🔍 We are continually adding to this and recently loaded more than 20 new keywords to make it easier to find insurance-related things.
Fixes
Schedule
: We came across an issue for staff with
practitioner-limited access
that was preventing you from being able to see or update reservations (bookings that are started, but not finalized) that you created. That has been fixed now so you will always have the ability to manage the reservations you create.
Outcome Measure Surveys:
We realized that surveys were showing more decimal places than needed so we have put those rogue decimals back in their place. 🧑🏻‍🏫
🔝

Changelog: January 3rd, 2024
Statements & Email With Pay Button
ICYMI, our Jane Payments users received a last-minute holiday gift at the end of December. 🎁
Now, when you are sending clients their statements, there is an option to include a secure link for clients to pay their outstanding balance online. We hope that this addition will increase the chances of you getting paid quickly.
Side-by-Side Photos Chart Part
Last month, we released a new chart part that allows you to upload two images beside one another in a patient’s chart to help you document your clients’ care visually. You are able to draw or notate on the images if you like, and more easily share comparison photos with your clients so they may see their progress for themselves.
Improvements
Translation:
We’ve made some updates to Jane’s fonts behind the scenes so we can now support extra accented characters that are common in the alphabet for some of our global users, like our friends in Slovakia. 🇸🇰
Fixes
🇺🇸 We fixed an issue with Jane’s permissions that was preventing Administrator / All Billing users in the US from accessing the new Merge Insurers tool.
Phrases
:
We noticed Jane wasn’t always honouring your formatting (like capitalizing letters or bolding words) so, moving forward when you create a Phrase with formatting, Jane will save those details so they appear every time you use that new phrase.
Surveys
:
We learned that if some folks completing a survey pressed Enter while providing details within a checkbox with notes field, the survey would submit as if complete. We can’t have that, so it’s been corrected.
Intake Forms
:
We fixed an issue that was preventing some of you who aren’t using Jane Payments from saving Intake Forms because Jane was asking for credit card settings to be set up. No more red error messages for you.❗
Reports:
We noticed that Jane was displaying the legal name of an insurer instead of the internal name on insurance reports when exported, so we took care of that.
We resolved an issue where the
Inventory
and
Product Performance
reports were displaying blank pages when printed.

🆕 Chart Search Filter
Searching for Chart Entries, Intake Forms, or Surveys in a patient chart just got easier with a new “Entry Types” search filter to help narrow your scope and find the entry you need much quicker.
To check this out, head to any patient chart, select
Filter / Export
and you’ll see the new
Entry Types
option to filter for what you are looking for.
Improvements
Online Booking:
For clinics with lots of practitioners and treatments, Jane was a little slow to show patients the available appointments when booking online, so we’ve done a little tinkering under the hood to bring your patients those options much quicker. 🏎️
Treatment Plans
:
If you’ve ever created a new chart entry under the wrong patient profile, we’ve made it possible to move that chart entry from within a Treatment Plan to another patient’s chart.
Insurance Policies Report:
We heard that it would be nice to filter this report by Staff Member, so now, you’ll see this helpful addition on the filter bar.
Jane Payments
:
For our friends in Greece, you’re now able to sign up with Jane Payments so you can start to get paid easier. Opa! 🇬🇷
Translation
: For our clinics in Morocco, you may now update your Language settings to the newly added
French - Morocco
option so you may choose to display all client-facing communication en français.
Chart Note Export
:
When you’re exporting a patient chart and need an updated copy, we’ve made it easier to see how to do that on the spot. We’ve replaced an inconspicuous black button with a pretty Jane blue “Load a fresh copy” link. We hope you like it!
Fixes
🇨🇦 Insurance:
We were told that the 👁️ icon in the Provider settings for the TELUS eClaims integration wasn’t revealing the password as intended, so that’s been fixed.
Charting:
We fixed up some confused special characters that were showing up in exported Chart PDFs. Now, when you have an &, >, or < in your notes, they’ll show up as they are supposed to.
Treatment Plans:
We noticed that archived draft chart entries were still being counted in Treatment Plans. We’ve taken care of that so those entries stay out of sight where they belong.
We’ve ensured that when you are exporting charts from a Treatment Plan, the plan details will be included so all the relevant information is available on those exported files.
🔝

Changelog: December 1st, 2023
Treatment Plans
Treatment Plans are now available on Jane’s Insurance Plan, making it easier to provide better care and track patient progress. Now, you can track the start and end date of treatment for a specific diagnosis, count the number of appointments attended, and have greater visibility into patient treatment across a clinic.
To try it out, head to a patient’s charting area and you will see a 🆕
New Treatment Plan
button. Once clicked, you may fill in the Treatment Plan Name, then add an Area of Focus, and a suggested number of visits.
We’re working to add more to this feature in the future and would love to
hear your feedback
as we continue to develop it.
Merge Insurers
We are excited to bring our 🇺🇸 clinic friends the ability to merge two duplicate insurers with just a couple of clicks. This was previously not possible without a call to the Jane team. For any folks outside of the US, if you would find this function helpful too, let our team know!
To check this out, head to
Settings > Insurers
and you’ll see a lovely 🆕
Merge Insurers
button.
Improvements:
Translations
:
For those with account locales set to French, we noticed that Jane wasn’t translating the patient number, date of birth, and email details for you when exporting a chart entry, so that’s been taken care of.
We’ve added a new currency translation for our clinics in Morocco 🇲🇦
Accessibility:
We are striving to improve the experience of navigating the Day View for folks using a screen reader tool. Now, you may press “Enter” on an appointment to open up the patient’s chart directly.
Fixes:
Intake Forms
:
We heard that Jane wasn’t allowing you to add new consents to Intake Forms when all previous consents had been deleted.  This has been fixed so you won’t be stuck in limbo any longer.
It appeared that Claim Numbers were occasionally not appearing on Intake Forms, but we’ve let the forms know that it’s time for the game of hide and seek to be over.
We also found an error that was occasionally causing Jane to send too many Intake Forms. Nobody wants extra work to do, so we quickly fixed that up.
Charting:
We were told that Jane had confused some words in the
Optical Measurement Table
. We corrected that so
cycle
is now
cylinder
and Jane is going to book in for an eye exam. 👓
We heard that
Classes
were disappearing from the schedule when all participants were removed by a staff member leaving an empty class. We have fixed this up so Classes will always be in attendance on your schedule — no more skipping! 🧑🏻‍🏫
We’ve also tightened up the
access for staff members
with Practitioner (Limited) permissions so that they cannot see Product sales for other practitioners’ patients.

Changelog: November 14th, 2023
Treatment Duplication
Whether you are in the process of setting up your Jane account for the first time, or are planning on adding new treatments at your clinic, you’ll now be able to create a new treatment, class, or group appointment by duplicating an existing offering in your account, saving you valuable time while still allowing you to offer as many customized treatments as you’d like without having to start from scratch.
To try this, Full Access users can head to
Settings
>
Treatments, Classes & Group Appointments
, and you’ll see a handy 🆕 Duplicate button next to the treatment you’d like to copy.
Clinic Sites Integration
For those of you that have created brilliant websites with our friends at Clinic Sites, it is now much easier to access your website admin page from right within Jane. Head to your
Settings
>
Integrations
and you’ll see 🆕 “Sign-In” button to easily access your website to make changes. Could it get any easier?
Yes, it can! Now if you are just getting started with Jane, the Onboarding Wizard will offer to help you get started with Clinic Sites - only if you want to, of course. Simply follow the prompts to
Start Your Site
💫
Improvements:
Activity Log
:
For Account Owners who like to stay on top of changes being made in your accounts, we’ve added some more specifics regarding treatments so that you have more information. Now, you’ll be able to see additional details, like which specific treatment was updated or created.
🇺🇸
Insurance Billing:
We heard that the Remittance progress bar was a little confusing because it didn’t expand the length of the screen when all steps were complete. Quite frankly, we agree,  and now you’ll notice that helpful green line stretches fully across the page when you’ve finished reviewing your claims.
We’ve made a small change to the Claim Submissions folders. Modifiers are now displayed in the Procedures column in brackets to the right of each CPT code, so you can take a peek at what’s been added or missed before selecting the claims you’d like to bill.
Fixes:
Translation:
We noticed that the book-at-location phrasing for our French-speaking clinics was
pas très bon
so that’s been fixed.
Online Booking:
We noticed that Jane was adding an extra number on the online booking site when multiple openings were available within a set timeframe. Now the number shown will accurately reflect the right number of available appointments. No more unwanted +1s!
Schedule:
We heard that sometimes pressing the
tab
key after clicking on an appointment would cause a blank space to appear and block the screen. That’s been fixed up now so folks can tab away to their heart’s content and we can leave the Blank Space to Taylor Swift 🎶
Intake Forms
:
We have acted on some feedback from our mental health helpers, to ensure that when creating new intake forms, they will not be set up to send automatically by default. You’ll be able to make that change when you are ready to start sending those forms.
🇨🇦
Insurance (BC)
:
A few improvements for our BC customers billing MSP 🗣️  You know that frustrating feeling when you get a vague error message, and it disappears in the blink of an eye? Us too! Now, when you’re checking eligibility for MSP supplementary benefits, we’ll do our best to give you more info on those pesky errors. Plus, the error message won’t vanish into thin air anymore – it’ll stick around in the patient profile.

ICD-10 Code Set Update
It’s that time of year when we hunker down and do some organizing and purging to stay on top of CMS updates. We added 19 CPT codes to Jane’s library and tidied away several old codes that are no longer valid or needed.
Phrases Update
You can now create a new
Phrase
directly from a chart as you type it, rather than having to do it from your staff profile. We hope this helps you chart even faster than before 🎉
Improvements:
Patient Search:
If you’ve ever had trouble distinguishing between patients and clients with similar names, the search is over. When typing in the Patient Search Tab, Jane now shows you some additional helpful context -
the phone number and the birthdate
- so you can more easily find the profile you’re looking for.
Adjustments:
We’ve made a few tweaks to the Billing Info area on your appointment panel so you no longer have to hover over the section to reveal the Adjustment button. No more playing hide and seek when trying to apply a price change or discount.
Fixes:
🇺🇸
Insurance Billing
: Jane wasn’t picking up on occasional changes to the type of patient responsibility entered in EOBs (i.e. copay swapped for coinsurance). Whenever you edit an EOB going forward, you can rest easy knowing that the right type of patient responsibility will be displayed on patient invoices, receipts, and statements.
Translations:
For those of you with your clinic locale set to Japan 🇯🇵, we’ve corrected a small typo found on the Book By Discipline page.
For our clinics using any of our French locale settings, we’ve cleaned up the translation of “button” en français as it was previously shown in English.

Changelog: October 12th, 2023
🇺🇸 Billing Provider Update
Calling all U.S. insurance users. 📣 If you’re someone who works with Billing Provider information in Jane, this one’s for you! To simplify this process, we’ve made a few changes to the Staff Billing Settings and the Insurance Information section in Settings > Location.
Here’s what’s new:
💼 If you’re one of the many clinics that bill under one Billing Provider and Tax ID, you may likely find it tedious to update this information on every staff member’s profile. So to save you time, we’ve added an option allowing you to add a Tax ID and Billing Provider Taxonomy Code to your clinic location, instead of having to add this information to each individual staff member’s Billing Settings.
🚛 Since the Tax ID can be added to the location now, we’ve gone ahead and moved the Tax Id fields to the Custom Billing Provider section, and made these optional fields.
💡 We’ve also updated the labels and added some helpful tips to the fields listed under Settings > Locations > Insurance Information to make the process a bit more clear.
We hope this will provide a smoother and simplified experience when updating Billing Information in Jane, and hopefully prevent some unwanted billing errors! 💪
Learn more about setting up billing info >
Improvements:
🇺🇸
U.S. Insurance:
If you receive an ERA with more than 100 claim responses, Jane will now separate these into multiple pages to help avoid long lag times without disrupting your workflow.
Telehealth:
If you use Online Appointments for Groups, this one’s for you. We want your clients to have the best experience possible during online appointments, and we’ve heard time and time again that Chrome provides the most consistent experience when joining a call on desktop. So now when your clients get ready to join a call on a non-Chrome browser, we’ve sprinkled in some helpful reminders for them to use Chrome when possible, along with some other helpful tips!
Intake Forms:
To avoid unwanted client notifications, we’ve re-introduced an intake form time span for in-progress intake forms of 1 year or less. Only clients who haven’t completed their intake form within the last year will be prompted to complete them.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: September 11th, 2023
Update: Longer-term Memberships
The number of billing cycles you can set for your Memberships has been expanded from a maximum of 12 to a maximum of 52. This means you can now set your Memberships to bill clients
weekly for up to a year, monthly for a little over 4 years, or yearly for up to 52 years!
To try this, Full Access users can head to Settings > Packages & Memberships and either edit an existing or create a new Membership. In the “
Expires after
” field, you can click the drop-down next to Billing Cycles and choose between 1 and 52.
We hope this helps reduce the admin time and reminders needed to update your clients’ Memberships.
We also updated the way the list of billing events is sorted in the Client Profile > Billing > Packages & Memberships area. You won’t have to do quite so much scrolling to find the most recent billing cycle now, as we’ve defaulted them to sort from most to least recent.
Learn more about setting up your Memberships >
Accessibility Updates
The process of charting with a keyboard or screenreader just got a little bit easier. If a practitioner tabs through the Day View and presses Enter, Jane will now jump over to the Chart Entry area and can interact with the charts there. If they press Esc, Jane will jump back to where they left off in the Day View to continue navigating to the next appointment.

New Support Hours
Sometimes it’s nice to talk to a real human. To make it easier for you to get the answers you need when you need them, we’ve updated our support hours to now include Saturdays from 8am-12pm PT for our friends in Canada and the US, so now you have even more options to chat with our team. ☎️

Improvements:
🇨🇦 Insurance Integrations: We’ve updated user role permissions so that only Full Access users can access the
TELUS

Pacific Blue Cross PROVIDERnet
integration settings pages.
Accessibility:
We’ve made another accessibility improvement, so now anyone navigating with a keyboard won’t unintentionally open the Shift details if the Shift mode is not active.
My Account:
We’ve separated the documents area into pages in your client’s My Account portal to make scanning for information easier, especially for those with a lot of documents.
Chart Entries:
Now you can export chart entries that are missing thumbnails for uploaded Files without any issue.
Fixes:
Online Appointments for Groups:
In some instances, the Hide Self View option would accidentally disappear, so we’ve updated this so that it’s back and ready to use in your next Online Appointment.
🇺🇸
Claim Submissions:
We fixed a quirk that was occasionally causing practitioners to accidentally create duplicate electronic claim submissions.
Intake Forms:
We heard that some clients were receiving an error when filling out intake forms with a signature, so we’ve gone ahead and fixed that.
🪄Sometimes when clearing the settings search bar, the sidebar headings occasionally disappeared. Although we love a good magic trick, this is not the time for a disappearing act, so we’ve worked our magic and fixed that.

Accessibility Updates
We’ve made some more improvements to the way Jane works with screen readers. Previously, when looking to open and hop into the Appointment Panel, it took a lot of tabbing through other appointments on the Schedule to get there.
Now, when an appointment is selected, Jane will focus on the Appointment Panel right away. When you’re done with that Appointment Panel, you can hit the escape button and Jane will navigate back to the last appointment that was selected.
We hope this helps make it a lot easier to work with the Schedule for folks using screen readers!
Improvements:
Online Booking
: We tweaked the way each staff member’s name is displayed in the ‘Book by Treatment’ section of your Online Booking site. To match the formatting used on all the other pages, a staff member’s full name will now be shown instead of just their first name. And, to keep things tidy, Jane will switch to saying, “offered by
__
providers” when there are 5+ names listed.
Fixes:
Fullscript
: For a while, Fullscript recommendations weren’t appearing in Print views. We’ve fixed that up and you’ll see those appear as expected now.
System Status
: Did you know that Jane has a status page that can be accessed from the Need Help? menu in your Jane account? Ironically, that link wasn’t working for a little bit, but we’ve got it back up and running for you!

Integrated Claims with Claim.MD
It’s official — our

Chart Entries
: We’re excited to announce a small but mighty change to your charts. When you’re looking through your Chart Entries from your Staff profile, you now have the ability to use the @ symbol to search a specific client to help you narrow your results and improve the overall performance of your search 🔎.
Insurance Policies
: To make your life a bit easier, you can now sort your entire list of Insurance Policies at once instead of limiting this to 25 policies at a time. Head to
Billing > Insurer Invoices
and select an option to test it out!
Jane Payments
: We’ve updated how we’re saving cards on file through the Jane Payments Terminal, which will fix some scenarios where you told Jane to save the card, but Jane didn’t listen.
TELUS eClaims
: We made the referral date an optional field for Canada Life - PSHCP submissions through TELUS eClaims.
Box 24
: Clinics that bill Medicaid can now send EPSDT referral information in Box 24H of paper (CMS1500) and electronic claims (837p). You can learn more about this change in
our Box 24 guide
.
Jane Support
: We’ve updated our Need Help section to include support hours and instructions so that getting help when you need it is easier.
Accessibility in Jane
: We’re continuing to make improvements so that Jane is more accessible to all users.
We’ve made the waitlist hidden on screen readers when they’re visually hidden on the browser to help reduce auditory noise.
We’ve gone ahead and hidden the onboarding wizard from the screen reader when toggled shut to reduce auditory noise.
We’ve also updated the keyboard shortcuts to improve accessibility and polished up the design so it’s easier to consume.
Fixes
Group Appointments
: We heard that some of your clients found that the start time of a group appointment wasn’t being updated if a change was made to the appointment time during the booking process. So, we’ve gone ahead and updated this so that it’s consistent and accurate for all participants now.
Clinical Surveys
:
We fixed an issue that was allowing an invalid survey type to be selected when duplicating surveys.
We also added the staff member’s name and set-up date to the survey program history.
Intake Forms
:
We fixed an issue where some clients were not receiving the intake form they were eligible for.
Account Owners now have the ability to change the client on an intake form again.

New Arrived Colour
If you had the dark green turned on for your
Arrived + Paid appointments
, you may have noticed that the colours changed a bit.
The shade of green on the appointment is a little lighter and the text is dark grey instead of white.
These new colours were chosen to address
the feedback we received
on the previous colour choices while continuing to meet accessibility standards and call attention to appointments requiring client payment.
This doesn’t address

on how this feature works with $0 invoices (i.e. with insurance or charging by the unit). We’re still thinking about a better solution for that, so in the meantime, we’ve
built a toggle
(Schedule > ⚙️) that lets you turn the feature off if it’s not helpful for you.
Outcome Measure Surveys
In
Settings > Forms & Surveys
, you can create
Clinical Surveys
that can be set up individually or for all clients. You can enable scoring on your questionnaire to create
Outcome Measure Surveys
, or you can take a peek in our
Template Library
to grab pre-scored surveys (like a PHQ-9 or NDI) added by the community.
Just look for the little 📊 Score icon.
Once your surveys are built, you can head to your
clients’ profiles
to send them
individually
. Surveys can be sent:
Automatically: before or after every in-person visit to your practice
Automatically: on a regular schedule
Manually: whenever you choose, by selecting “
Don’t send automatically
” and then using the
3 dots
under “Action” to either email a new survey or Pass to Client.

Improvements
Treatments
: If you go to edit your treatments/sessions, you’ll notice that the treatment/session name is now at the top of the edit page and on the sticky header as you scroll through the settings so it’s easier to remember which one you’re working on.
Online Appointments for Groups
: We’re continuing to roll out improvements with a recent update that will make it more evident if you fail to connect to a call.
Clinical Surveys
: We’ve made a whole bunch of improvements based on feedback from our Outcome Measure Survey (see above!) beta testers, as well as some initial feedback after the updates went live for everyone.
You can now edit the name & type of a survey after its creation
We removed the need to enable/disable surveys
We enabled the pass-to-client flow for clinic-wide survey programs
We allowed full-access users to archive active surveys
We removed surveys set up as all client surveys (ex. covid screeners) from the patient profile as it was causing some confusion
🇨🇦
TELUS eClaims
:
Customers can now submit claims to PSHCP through the TELUS eClaims integration
Osteopaths and psychotherapists are now eligible to submit claims for their patients through the TELUS eClaims integration to participating insurers
Fixes
Online Appointments for Groups
: We fixed a bug that was causing a participant list to appear where your faces should be when someone shared their screen during a call.
Clinical Surveys
: Some of you were having trouble with the pass-to-client flow on mobile, so we’ve tidied that up and it should be working as expected now.

Changelog: June 12th, 2023
Update: Schedule Accessibility
As part of an ongoing effort to make the Schedule more accessible to our visually impaired users, we’ve made updates to a few components to make them readable by screen readers, like the Date-Picker and Break buttons.
Learn more about Accessibility in Jane >
Update: Wait List Notifications
Jane’s been brushing up on some translation skills! We’ve updated Jane’s Wait List Notification alerts so that they are automatically translated to the language that your account is set to. Now your clients will be alerted that a selected time is no longer available, or to view more availability in the language of your choice. We hope these small changes improve your client’s experience.
Update: Jane is now compatible with Google Analytics 4
On July 1st, Google is replacing Universal Analytics (UA) with
Google Analytics 4
(GA4), so we’ve done some tinkering and our
Google Analytics integration
is now GA4 compatible. If you’re using the integration, make sure to
update your tracking ID
in Jane before
July 1st, 2023
to keep your data flowing smoothly.
Check out our guide to learn more on how you can update your integration >
Note: The integration will be compatible with both UA and GA4 until July 1st when UA will no longer be supported.
Improvements:
Collect Payment for Late Cancellations:
Chasing after payments is no fun task, so we’ve added a Pay button to the Appointment Panel after you’ve selected a late cancellation fee to make it easier for you and your staff to collect payment for appointments that were cancelled too late.
Client Appointment Date Filter:
We were hearing that client profiles with extensive appointment history would sometimes take quite a long time to load up, so we’ve added a date range filter to the appointment list in your client profiles for faster results.
Fixes:
Online Appointments for Groups:
If you were playing around with your screen size during online appointments, you may have noticed that some buttons like screen share were missing when you reduced the size of your screen. We’ve gone ahead and fixed this for you so that now, regardless of your screen size, all desktop users will have access to all desktop functions.
Legal Names on Group Invoices:
We’ve made a few tweaks to our Group Appointment Invoices so that a client’s legal name is shown for other participants rather than their
preferred name
to help meet any legal or insurance-based requirements.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: May 29th, 2023
Update: Treatment/Session drop-down
We heard feedback that the new treatment drop-down we released back in March was too narrow to accommodate some longer treatment names, so we’ve decided to reinstate the previous drop-down style. Along with a wider view, this brings back the ability to select the appointment you’d like to book by typing its first letter on your keyboard.
You’ll still be able to book Group Appointments, Classes, and 1-on-1’s from the same flow, but it looks a little different now.
Improvements:
Insurance Policies Report
: We’ve made a slight change to the
exported
version of our Insurance Policies Report to show clients’ legal names instead of preferred names.
Fixes:
Treatment Ordering
: We resolved an issue where treatments were not showing up in the order they had been configured under Staff Profiles.
Intake Form Reminders
: We fixed an issue where intake form reminders were not being sent when booking appointments administratively.
Billing Codes in Charts
: Last but certainly not least, we’ve embarked on a bug-hunting expedition and emerged victorious! Those mischievous bugs that were causing trouble when syncing billing codes in a chart with an appointment? Well, consider them all squashed!
🔝

Changelog: May 15th, 2023
Updates: Online Gift Cards
We’ve made a few small tweaks to our Online Gift Cards in hopes of providing a better experience for your clients and helping you sell more gift cards:
🔗
A better link to your Online Gift Cards:
This link is easy to share via email or social and can be embedded into your website. It brings clients directly to your Online Gift Card purchase page and keeps them there once they’re signed in. You can head to Settings > Billing Settings > Gift Cards to grab the link.
📧
A quicker way to share Gift Card codes:
There’s now a Send button that will open up your client’s default email browser and pop the Gift Card code into an email along with an editable greeting.
🎁
Better visibility for your Online Gift Cards
: There’s now a shout-out and a link to your Online Gift Cards on the Booking Confirmation page of your Online Booking site.
Online Gift Cards are powered by
Jane Payments
. If you’re not signed up yet, you can learn about our
integrated payments here
. If you’d like to give it a go, head to
Settings > Jane Payments

in 5 minutes.
Let us know
if you have any questions.
Update: Arrived and Paid Colour
Recently, we made a change so that any Arrived appointment with a client-owed balance of $0 will turn dark green.
We heard that some folks would like to be able to turn this on/off, so we’ve made it selectable under your Schedule View Settings ⚙️ (Schedule > click the cog in the bottom right > toggle Differentiate Paid & Arrived States).
Toggling this on/off will only affect your own view of the Schedule/Day sheet. Each staff member in your Jane account can customize their own schedule view.
Improvements:
Insurance Info on Intake Forms
: We’ve added a Skip button to make it easier for clients without insurance to continue on to the rest of their Intake Form.
CPT & Diagnosis Codes
: Things were feeling a little sluggish when you went to re-order diagnosis codes on appointments, so we’ve brewed Jane an extra strong pot of coffee and things should be moving much quicker now.
Online Appointments for Groups
: Speaking of coffee, occasionally folks were finding that their screen would fall asleep during a group telehealth call. Jane should be wide awake now, so you shouldn’t see that happen anymore.
New Discipline
: We’ve added Psychotherapy as a new discipline category.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: May 3rd, 2023
A new colour on your Schedule
When an appointment has been marked as
Arrived
and the
client-owed amount is $0
, it will now turn
dark green
! This will let you see
at a glance
if there are any past appointments that you need to collect payments for.
💚 Light green appointment = Arrived + client balance is
unpaid
🌲 Dark green appointment = Arrived + client balance is
paid
or $0
C
lients may have a $0 balance if their appointment is fully billed to insurance or billed per unit
We really appreciate all of the feedback you provided on this update. We’re working on making this
a selectable option
in your Schedule View settings and will let you know when that’s ready in the next few weeks.
Improvements:
Scorable Surveys
: We’ve added a button to open up the
Chart Template Library
from the Questionnaire section of your
Clinical Surveys
for some quick inspiration and support. We’ve also added some labels to make it easier to find templates with scoring enabled while you’re looking through the library.
CMS1500
and
Superbills
: We’ve made an update to prevent timeout errors when a batch file is taking a little longer to load.
Insurance Info on Intake Forms
: We’ve added a Remove Policy button for your clients when they’re filling out their Intake Forms in case they need to redo the policy they’re adding.
🇨🇦
TELUS eClaims
: In line with a recent TELUS eClaims change, we no longer require or include Client Sex in TELUS eClaim submissions.
🇸🇪
Skål
! Jane can now speak Swedish.
Accessibility improvements to Jane’s Schedule
:
We’ve tweaked the
tabbing
function so that Jane moves through appointments in chronological order and you only have to hit the tab button once each time you want to skip to the next appointment.
The appointment details will also only be read once by screen readers (previously they were read twice).
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: April 19th, 2023
Go big 🔎
This is a small change that will be big for anyone whose appointments are shorter than 30 minutes. You can now increase the zoom-in on your Schedule to
200%.
This will allow you to see all your important appointment details at-a-glance.
To give it a try, you can head to your
Schedule
, click the
cog
in the bottom right corner of your screen, and choose 200% under ‘
Set Schedule Zoom
’.
Improvements
Working with the Schedule
: If there’s a client loaded in the search bar in the top left-hand corner of your Schedule, that client will now change as you click into different appointments. If you don’t want Jane to have an active client loaded, you can remove the client from the search bar using the little ‘x’ beside their name.
Upcoming or Past Appointments
: Previously, when you printed a list of upcoming or past Appointments from your client’s profile (under the Appointments tab), the day of the week was removed. We’ve added this to the printed version so your clients don’t have to refer to a calendar to find out when they saw/will be seeing you next.
Online Appointments for Groups:
Both your
Virtual Background
and
Speaker v. Gallery View Layout
will now be persistent settings. This means that, for example, if you’ve decided to blur your background in one call, it will remain blurred for the next one. Yay for fewer clicks and a little more privacy, wherever you choose to work.
The
Network Strength Indicator
, which shows how strong and stable everyone’s internet is, will now work in all browsers!
Outcome Measures Surveys:
We fixed up an issue that was preventing you from deactivating Clinical Surveys after they were sent to clients.
If you enable scoring on your Clinical Surveys, those will now show on the printed/exported versions of completed surveys.
Insurance:
🇺🇸
Billing Codes
: We tightened a few things up under the hood to make your most frequently used billing codes load a little quicker when you search for them.
🇨🇦
TELUS eClaims
: We’ve added Simply Benefits as a new insurer.
Reporting Improvements:
Prefixes: We added your Staff prefixes like Dr. or Ms. (
if you choose to include them
) to a number of reports.
Top Clients Report
: We added the options to export to CSV and Excel formats. Woohoo!
🔝

Changelog: March 20th, 2023
One booking workflow to rule them all 💍
Last week, we made a change that allows you to book
all
of your appointment types (
Group Appointments, Classes, and 1:1s
) by clicking on the Schedule and choosing the appointment from the
Treatment/Session drop-down
on the Appointment panel.
To make this change possible, you’ll notice we had to do a little switcharoo of the
Treatment and Patient fields
. ⤵️
💭
Previously, the only way to book a Group Appointment or Class was to select it under the staff name on the left and drop it onto the schedule (you can still do this if you’d like).
Some of our community provided quick feedback on a few unintended changes with this feature, so we’ve started working on those. Thanks so much to everyone who let us know if something wasn’t feeling quite right. 💙
🚀 We’ve fixed up the way you add an insurance policy when booking an appointment so Jane behaves as expected whether you choose to add the Patient or the Treatment first.
🔜 We had omitted some info about a Patients last appointment, so we’re going to add all of that back in.
🔜 We heard that the Treatment drop-down was too narrow to accommodate some longer Treatment names, so we’re working on ensuring everything fits on one line.
Update: Credit Cards on Intake Forms
The credit card collection field on your Intake Forms can now be made
required
. 🙌
Clients will only be asked to complete this step if there isn’t already a credit card connected to their account. If you’d like to turn this on, you can head to
Settings > Forms & Surveys > Intake Forms
and edit your form.
Thanks so much to everyone who provided their feedback on how this change would be helpful. If you’re not using
Jane Payments

Improvements
Sales Report
: We’ve added a No Charge filter option so you can get a more complete overview of your appointments.
Outcome Measure Surveys
: We’ve made an update that lets you see the total score when you’re looking at an open Chart Entry.
Online Appointments for Groups
We added a banner to the waiting room that helps clients and providers feel confident they’ve got their microphone and camera permissions enabled. We hope this saves you from getting really good at miming to your clients to enable their microphones. 🎙️
You now have Persistent Settings for your camera, speaker, and microphone inputs/outputs! This means that Jane will remember if you joined your last appointment with your headphones/webcam/external speakers and automatically use those if you have them connected to your computer when you join a call.
Fixes
Self Check-In
: We fixed an issue where SMS Self Check-In links would expire immediately for Android users.

Outcome Measure Surveys
We’re excited to be releasing the first part of this feature because we know it will be helpful for so many of you, and we can’t wait for you to see what’s coming soon!
🎉 Here’s what you can do with
Outcome Measure Surveys
right now:
Enable scoring for your checkboxes, sliders, or drop-downs on a Clinical Survey (Settings > Forms & Surveys ) and let Jane do the math for you when an Outcome Measure Survey is completed.
Use an Outcome Measure Survey for an individual client by
adding it to their chart
as a Chart Entry and filling it in on their behalf. You can make sure your surveys appear when you click New Chart Entry by going to your Staff Profile > Templates > Surveys.
Automatically send a survey to
all clients
before or after
all appointments
or at the time of
booking.
💌
Here’s what’s coming soon:
Sending Outcome Measure Surveys to
individual clients
, either manually or automatically.
The ability to share templates that include scoring in the Chart Template Library.
Demo Clinic Password
Did you know we have a
Demo Clinic
where you can
play with new features
and
test out workflows
without creating any messy data in your account? Well, we’ve just made it easier to access by adding the password to your

menu.
Improvements
Late Cancellations
: We’ve made an update so that Late Cancellations appear as line items on your Product Performance report (just like No-Shows).
Online Appointments for Groups
:
Virtual backgrounds
(with Chrome browser only): We’ve added a few virtual background options, so you can now join your call from the ocean, the forest, or even outer space. 💫
Network indicator
: Can you hear me now? Similar to how you can check for bars on your cellphone, you can now check for bars on a video call. We’ve added an icon to the upper right-hand corner of your screen to help you see how strong your internet is. You’ll also receive a notification if you experience a significant drop in your connection.
Reports
:
The
Adjustments Report
can now be exported to CSV and Excel.
The
Sales Report
has a new income state filter for Partially Paid invoices.

Changelog: February 21st, 2023
Online Appointments for Groups
You can now host HIPAA, PIPEDA, and GDPR-compliant online sessions for 2-12 related clients, without leaving Jane. This is an
optional add-on to any Jane plan, at $15 per practitioner per month.
This will be great for sessions with multiple clients who know each other, like family and couples therapy—
we’re still working on creating a great experience for unrelated groups and classes
. 1:1 Online Appointments will continue to be free for everyone. 🎉
We’ve added some exciting features like blurred backgrounds, a session timer, chat, hand raising, and hi-def video.
Learn more about Online Appointments for Groups >
Our goal has always been to keep Jane affordable for you and that hasn’t changed. Adding extra participants to a telehealth session is (surprisingly!) expensive for us to run. So, by adding a flat rate per practitioner, we’re trying to ensure that you only pay for those in your practice who will use it and that we can continue to build great features for you.
As always, we’d love to hear your feedback so we can continue to grow and make sure you’re getting great value for the cost of Jane.
Improvements
We’ve added a new loading message: A Ralph Waldo Emerson quote that Ali, our co-founder, loves. Let us know if you see it the next time to log on! 👀
Shifts
: You can now feed two birds with one scone and delete any breaks that exist within a Shift when that Shift is deleted.
Intake Form Reminders
: We’ve added an automatic reminder for Intake Forms that are sent manually and are incomplete 24 hours before the client’s next appointment.
Fixes
Late Cancellations
: We heard that the way the new invoicing option for Late Cancellations was being billed to clients’ insurance wasn’t working for some practices. We fixed that up so that Late Cancellation invoices act a bit more like No-Shows and assume the client will be responsible for the cost.
Treatments/Sessions
: We fixed a quirk where Jane lost track of the order of Treatments when there was a long list of them. Your Treatments should all stay in the order you left them from now on.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: February 6th, 2023
🇺🇸 Update: Improved Statement Filtering
In addition to our
recent updates to Diagnosis Codes on Statements
, we’ve added a 3rd filter option to exclude Diagnosis Codes altogether. When selected, this filter produces Statements that show only CPT codes and insurance details.
Improvements
Reporting Improvements
:
Sales Report
: We took the Sales Report in for its annual service so when you go to export it, that clanking under the hood should be gone (aka it should load a little quicker for you 😉).
Online Appointment Usage Report
: This report can now be exported to Excel/CSV to allow you to dive a little deeper into your usage.
Unapplied & Applied Payments Report
: We’ve improved the date formats on this report so that they’re easier to sort when exported to Excel.
Activity Log
: If you’ve ever come across a log item saying
, “So-and-so
destroyed
on Tuesday at 12 pm
”, you’ve likely thought to yourself, “… destroyed
what
, Jane?!”. We’ve been there. So, we asked Jane to provide a little more context (i.e. “destroyed a Shift”) to help prevent confusion.
Disciplines
: We’ve separated the Kinesiology/Athletic Therapy Discipline into 2 separate Disciplines— Kinesiology
and
Athletic Therapy. ✌️ To update your Discipline, you can head to Settings > Disciplines and click edit. Then, you can choose the appropriate Discipline from the Category drop-down list.
If you use Online Booking, you may also need to edit your
Name
and
Professional title
to update what displays to the public. If you’re not sure which title you should be using, we encourage you to reach out to your regulatory body.
PCI Compliance
: To help you maintain PCI compliance, we’ve added a warning that appears if you try to type a credit card number into a Chart Entry. It will prevent you from Signing the Chart Entry until the card number is removed. For more info, you can check out our update
from last week
. ⤵️
Fixes
Relationships
: We’ve tidied up an issue where duplicate emails were being sent when a new Relationship was created. Clients should now only receive a single, consolidated update when you set up their Relationship.
🔝

Changelog: January 23rd, 2023
Improved PCI Compliance
If you’re not familiar with
PCI Compliance
, it’s a standard to ensure business owners are maintaining safe payments for their clients, including proper storage of credit card information.
Jane is a secure platform for storing clients’ data, but it can still be used in ways that are not PCI-compliant, like collecting and storing credit card numbers in plain text in chart entries.
To help you maintain compliance, we’ll be
removing the ability to record credit card information in charting fields
(
including Intake Forms
) by
January 31st.
📆 Similar to other note fields in Jane, any 16-digit number will be replaced with stars once saved.
🎉
Jane Payments
is PCI compliant
and allows you to easily collect and store credit card info in three ways:
Collect Credit Cards through Online Booking
Collect Credit Cards on Intake Forms
Collect Credit Cards using the Jane Payments Terminal

Better Cancellations in Jane
We made 3 updates that will make managing and tracking cancelled appointments better:
⌚
Late Cancellation Invoices:
You can now
set custom fees
for your late cancellations, just like you have for No-Shows (
Settings > Fees
)!
Once set, these fee options will be available during the Late Cancellation Period when you click the Cancel button on an appointment.
💬
Reason for Cancellation
:
As you cancel an appointment, you’ll notice your Reasons for Cancellation now appear in a pop-out box.
This includes a new “Other” option that allows you to add specific reasons as needed for easier-to-track cancellations.
⏪ Undo a Cancellation:
Finally, once that appointment has been cancelled, you can now reverse the cancellation if it was done in error.
These are small changes that we hope make a big impact!
Learn more >
Intake Form Reminders
Speaking of making a big impact (drum roll, please 🥁)… Every Intake Form will now include an
automated email reminder that will be sent 24 hours before an appointment
if the form is incomplete!
We hope this helps reduce the amount of time you spend emailing clients and ensures more appointments start with completed forms.
Learn more >
Improvements:
The Sales Report
: We made a tweak to the Sales Report to show partially paid invoices when the All Outstanding filter is selected. This should make the math a little math-ier for you.
Diagnosis Codes on Statements
: We changed the way that diagnosis codes are formatted on receipts, invoices, and statements (
but not superbills
) by removing the diagnosis code description and separating all codes by commas (instead of having one per row).
You’ll see these changes applied to purchases invoiced after January 9th.
Procedure Codes
: After updating the price of a procedure code, you can now edit that procedure code on an existing appointment to update the price. To do this, click Change Billing Code and re-select the same procedure.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: January 9th, 2023
Update:
Mailing Client Statements
We’ve reformatted the clinic address on
Printed (Mail)
Client Statements to fit within the return address window of double-window envelopes. We hope this saves you a little time (and ink or stickers) when mailing out your statements!
Improvements
Billing Codes
: We’ve done a little tinkering under the hood so that Jane pulls up your custom, favourited, and most relevant Procedures and Diagnosis codes a little quicker when searched.
Chart Templates
: You can now duplicate Chart Parts when you’re building or editing your templates for quicker, easier template creation!
Translations
:
We’ve cleaned up some of our translations
en français
in our cancellation emails and the “Welcome back” message in Online Booking
We’ve added labels for the required fields on Intake Forms
en español
🇺🇸
Electronic claims (837)
: Jane can now support Supervising and Ordering providers on electronic claims! Previously, both were communicated as Referring providers, which occasionally caused a rejection. We hope this makes your billing a little smoother.

You can now enable the sale of Gift Cards through your Online Booking site! Purchasers can buy gift cards through their secure client portal via

Statements
: We increased the font size of the mailing address from 12px to 14px to make our printed snail mail Statements a little easier on your mail delivery person’s eyes.
🇺🇸
Insurance Billing
: We did a little tinkering under the hood and souped-up Jane’s performance when posting EOBs, and generating individual superbills and CMS1500s. Zoom zoom.
Fixes
Wait List
: Jane was doing a little interior design work and accidentally turned the Wait List bubble green. Those bubbles are back to their cheery orange once again.
Forms and Surveys
: The new Settings screen for Intake Forms, Clinical Surveys, and Rating & Reviews, wasn’t formatted for medium-sized screens (like a tablet). That’s all fixed up now, and you’ll be able to work on those from whichever device you like.

Save Credit Cards from the Jane Payments Terminal
You can now optionally save a credit card on file when your client taps, swipes, or inserts their card into your

Pay Balance Texts (SMS)
Raise your hand if your inbox is a little… messy these days. 🙋‍♀️Jane’s got you covered: Cut through the clutter by sending a
Pay Balance Text Message
using
Jane Payments
. You can add a personalized message while sending your client a secure link to pay their outstanding balance. Clients can pay from anywhere through their client portal with a card-on-file, or Apple or Google Pay.
Making it easier for clients to pay means a better chance of you getting paid, sooner. Read more about this and other ways clients can
Pay Balances Online.
Improvements:
Searching Charts
: You might notice that the search function in your charts has been even more helpful recently (and if you haven’t, give it a try!). We’ve added a little extra logic to Jane so you can spend less time flipping through charts and more time getting ready for your next client.
Deleting Client Files
: Account Owners can now delete files from a client’s Files tab, regardless of who uploaded them, as long as it isn’t included in the client’s Chart.
Fixes:
Electronic Claim Submission
: We fixed an issue with the way staff phone numbers were formatted in electronic submissions (837) that would occasionally trigger a clearinghouse rejection. If you’ve ever been given a fake phone number, you’ll understand the feeling. 😉
Pay Balance Emails
: For a brief time, Jane wasn’t allowing some practitioners to send Pay Balance Emails, even if they had the Access Billing permission selected in their Staff Profiles. We’ve reminded Jane that anyone with that box ticked should be allowed to collect payments, so things should be back to normal now.

Settings Page Redesign
Jane has grown up a lot over the past few years, so the Settings list has gotten longer and each page within that has gotten a little busier. To help make it easier to manage your Jane account, our team is embarking on a Settings Redesign journey. We’ve got two exciting changes for you this week:
#1: Clinic Info & Locations
We’ve started with the first place most people land when they’re getting set up:
Clinic Info & Locations.
We’ve broken this page into 2 separate tabs (Clinic Info, Locations) to keep things clearer and easier to manage as you add/edit some of the most essential information about your practice.
#2: Intake Forms, Clinical Surveys, and Ratings & Reviews
We’ve also built a new home for the setup of your client forms and surveys (Intake Forms, Clinical Surveys, Reviews & Ratings). These are now conveniently grouped together in the
Forms and Surveys
tab.
If you’re ever looking for any of your Settings pages, you can find them quickly by typing a keyword into the Setting Search bar in the top lefthand corner of your Settings.
Fixes:
Charting on an iPad
: If you were trying to access a chart from the Day view on an iPad recently, you may have noticed Jane wasn’t being quite as helpful as usual. We’ve done a little tinkering, and your charts should open as normal again.
Improvements:
🇺🇸
Secondary Claim Submission
: We added some messaging for when a primary claim response isn’t automatically added to a secondary claim. Reasons include:
🙅 The primary payer forwarded the secondary claim on the clinic’s behalf
🙅 The primary response should not be used for billing secondaries
🙅 The procedures in the primary response don’t match the procedures on the claim
🙅 There is another ‘valid’ primary response with a more recent effective date
🇬🇧
UK Insurance
: We’ve made a few more updates to insurance policy terms for our mates in the UK. This is a small part of our ongoing work to build better regional insurance features in Jane.

Payments for Related Clients
Do your clients want to pay all the invoices for their family visit with a single transaction? Or would they like to pay their child’s invoice and be reflected as the payer? Good news: You can now do both in Jane. 🎉
This new way to pay uses Jane’s Relationship feature to create a more streamlined checkout for you and your clients, as well as more accurate receipts and statements.
Learn all about how you can get going with Payments for Related Clients!
Charting for Classes or Group Appointments
To streamline the workflow for those seeing multiple clients at once, we’ve created a shortcut that allows you to copy a signed Chart Entry from one client’s chart to another’s.
This option will appear on any Chart Entry with a Class or Group Appointment attached to it. If you need a refresher on attaching Chart Entries to appointments,
you can check this guide out
!
We hope this makes your charting for Groups and Classes a little easier.
You can learn all about it here!
Fixes:
🇨🇦
Canadian Insurance Integrations
: There was a little bug that was allowing users to accidentally double-submit claims to TELUS eClaims or Pacific Blue Cross. We asked it to pack up its things and go, so it shouldn’t be pestering anyone anymore.
Improvements
Settings Search Bar:
Jane just got smarter! We’ve been working on expanding Jane’s vocab when it comes to searching your Settings. You can now type in all sorts of things that you remember seeing (
somewhere
in the Settings) and Jane will pull it up for you. 💪
Editing Quick-Click Chart Parts
: We’ve made it a whole lot easier to edit your checkboxes, drop-downs, range scales, and Smart Options & Narratives. You can now drag and drop items into place, rather than rewriting your list of options. Happy editing!

US Insurance: Secondary Claim Management in Jane
There’s a new workflow in town and it will make managing your secondary claims in Jane so much better. That includes billing secondary submissions electronically.
Starting
October 18th
here’s what you’ll see:
📂 All
new
secondary claims will automatically be put into the
Waiting on Primary
claim submission folder
A
ny existing secondary claims (generated before October 18th) will remain in their current folder
🚀 Once the primary claim is marked
Approved
, Jane will
move the secondary claim
to your
Draft or Unsubmitted
claim folder (based on your Billing Settings)
💪 If you submit to Insurers that automatically forward secondary claims for you (like Medicare), you can indicate that in
Settings > Insurers
and Jane will automatically mark your secondary claims as Submitted at the same time as the primary
🪄 If you upload
ERAs
, Jane will
automagically
fill in the primary remittance information
that’s required to bill secondary claims
You can
check out our guide
for all the details!
Improvements:
Primary Phone Number
: You can now indicate your client’s primary phone number in their profile so you have a visual cue telling you which number to call first! We hope this makes it a little easier for you to get in touch with your clients (on the first try 😉).
🇺🇸
Locations
: Jane now includes Armed Forces Americas (AA), Armed Forces Europe (AE), or Armed Forces Pacific (AP) in the State drop-down options for Client Profiles, Staff Profiles, and Clinic Locations.
Fixes:
Credit cards on Intake Forms
: Jane was displaying the cancellation policy on the Credit Card section of your Intake Forms in seconds instead of hours. While we appreciate the attention to detail, we’ve asked Jane to zoom out a little to make the policy easier to understand.

ICD10 Code Set
Effective October 1st, we’ve added 1176 new billable diagnosis codes to the ICD10 set in accordance with
CMS’s 2023
updates. To give you a bit of time to get your charts and billing up-to-date, we’ll wait until October 11th, and then we’ll remove any codes that are no longer in use.

Settings > Intake Forms > Credit Cards
. Once enabled, clients without a card on file will be asked to add their card info the next time they’re prompted to fill out an Intake Form.
Credit card info entered on Intake Forms will be stored as a
secure token
on your clients’ profiles, ready to be used when you need it.

🆕 Billing Notices on your clients’ Profile
We’ve added a one-stop shop for collecting A/R right from your clients’ main Profile page! The Billing Notices box will show any Private Outstanding balances and give you the option to send an email request for payment or process a payment on the spot.

🇺🇸 Session/Treatment-Specific Place of Service Codes
If you need to
bill or provide superbills using more than one Place of Service (POS) code
, you can now set a default POS code for your practice, as well as specific codes for any services that require it!
In your
Location Settings,
you can set a code that will apply to all Sessions/Treatments that don’t have a specific POS code added, and in your
Sessions/Treatments Settings,
you can enter a code that will only apply to that specific appointment type.
This update was inspired by practices
billing/providing superbills for Telehealth and in-person visits
, but will be helpful for anyone who needs to use different POS codes from a single Location in their Jane account!
Learn all about it in our Setting a Place of Service Code guide!
Thanks so much to our community members who helped us understand this pain point!
We love that we get to grow Jane alongside you.
💙 This is another step towards making Jane the best it can be for those of you billing insurance and providing superbills.
Improvements:
Insurance Info on Intake Forms
: We’ve tweaked the insurance collection step on intake forms to make it a little more streamlined. Your client’s address will now automatically pre-populate with what they’ve entered on the previous page, saving them from having to enter that info in twice.
Groups
: When we added our shiny new Group section to the client Profile, we didn’t realize we had added it right where the Chart option used to be. We’ve moved it along so you can continue to chat with your clients, grab your equipment, and navigate Jane at the same time without stumbling upon something unexpected.
Wait List Notifications
: We’ve made an update so that Wait List Notifications will work according to each client’s
Online Booking Policy
. So, any Wait List client with Online Booking disabled will receive notifications telling them to call to book, while any Wait List client with Online Booking enabled will receive an email that lets them choose an opening online!
🇺🇸
ERA Management
: Jane now displays insurer Remarks (Remittance Advice Remark Codes), for those of you uploading ERAs. When an insurer sends Remarks, you’ll find them under the Messages column in the Claim Response screen. Our goal is for you to never have to leave Jane to bill insurance, and this is one small, remark-able step in that direction. 😉

🆕 Group Appointments
Tandem bikes, paddling a canoe, moving a couch… some things are just better when you get to do them with others. That’s why we’re so excited to announce that you now have the ability to schedule
Group Appointments
in Jane! 🎉 This allows you to book multiple clients into a single session with a single invoice.
We’re still hard at work on a few more goodies to help with your Group Appointments (Group Telehealth and Group Billing are coming this Fall!), so stay tuned for those in the coming months.

Gift Cards
: For a long time, gift card-related transactions were excluded from the Statement in a client’s Billing profile, resulting in a balance that didn’t accurately reflect what was shown in their profile or what they really owed. We’ve made some tweaks and things are now perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
🔝

Changelog: August 8th, 2022
Update: Insurance Policy Viewing
When you go to view a client’s Insurance Policy, you’ll now be able to see a lot more info at-a-glance!
We’ve added details like the policy holder’s relationship to the insured (along with their name and DOB), the Prior Authorization Number, Insurance Plan Name, and default coverage amounts. We hope this removes a few extra clicks from your billing workflows.
🇺🇸 Removing an Insurance Policy from an Appointment
We added an extra safeguard for anyone trying to remove an Insurance Policy from an Arrived appointment after a claim has already been submitted.
Now, Jane will pop up to let you know how many claims have already been submitted and remind you that deleting it will also delete the claim, unlink associated responses, and delete all submissions. Better safe than sorry!
Improvements
Account Activity Notifications
: We’re always working to make Jane even more secure, so over the coming months, you and your clients will start to notice heads-up emails that are sent from Jane whenever a password, email, or address is changed, or when there’s a login to an account from a new device.
Fixes
Signing & Locking a Chart Entry
: The lock that appears on your Day sheet to let you know whether a Chart Entry has been signed got a little sticky. It wasn’t locking until you refreshed your page, so we sprayed some WD-40 on it and it’s back to snapping shut as soon as you hit that Sign button. 🔒

Managing your Jane Subscription
We’re making it easier to
update your Jane subscription
as you add/reactivate and delete/deactivate Staff members in your Jane account! Jane will ask a few quick questions to help automatically increase or decrease your license count as needed. Whenever the license count is changed, the Account Owner will receive an email letting them know. Account Owners can still manually update their subscription from Settings > Jane Subscription, as well, but this should help remove a few extra clicks from the process!
We’ll be rolling this out over the next couple of weeks, so if you don’t see it in your account quite yet, you can check back soon!
Improvements
Emails
: We’ve made Emails that are sent from Jane easier to read by changing the text colour to add a little more contrast.
Jane’s System Status Page
: We’ve improved our System Status page to keep you up to date in the (rare!) event that Jane is having a bad day. With this update, we can send notifications directly to your Jane account if a feature or integration you use is temporarily down.
Fixes
🥷
Privacy Mode
: There were a few places that Jane was forgetting to blur when in Privacy Mode (Shift + P), like certain spots on the Sales Report, Purchase View, or Patient Profile Billing area. We’ve fixed that up so you don’t have to worry about anyone peeking over your shoulder, no matter which part of Jane you’re working in.
Mailchimp
: Emails that were entered into Jane using capital letters weren’t syncing to Mailchimp for anyone using the integration. We’ve asked Jane to be a little less case-sensitive and your client’s emails should sync without issue moving forward.

Changelog: July 11th, 2022
Update: Pronouns
We’ve added an option to your Clinic Info & Location Settings to
enable/disable
pronouns
in your clients’
My Account
. We’ve decided to put this back in your hands so that, by giving your clients the option to update their pronouns, you’re able to more intentionally signal whether or not you can provide inclusive care.
Improvements
Online Booking Branding
: We know you work hard on your branding, and we always want to respect that. We’ve made some updates to ensure the logo you upload to your Online Booking site is as crisp and clear as can be.
Intake Forms
: The Online Intake Form section of your Clients’ Profile shows you all of their completed and pending Intake Forms. We had originally named the column that shows whether a form has been completed or not “Submitted”, which turns out was a little optimistic. 😉 It’s now called “Status” to more accurately reflect the information being provided.
Fixes
Schedule View
: We noticed that client’s prefixes were not reliably showing up on the schedule. We pulled Jane aside and explained that if someone spends 10-15 years in school to get their PhD or MD, the least we can do is refer to them as “Dr.”

Accept Tips with the Jane Payments Terminal
We know that asking if someone wants to tip after a treatment can be, well, a little awkward. That’s why we’re so excited that you can now set up your Jane Payments Terminal to prompt your clients for you!
You can even set some standard tip amounts (ex. 10%, 12%, 15%) along with the option to add a custom tip or skip it altogether. You can also turn off tips during a particular client’s check out if it doesn’t feel like an appropriate time to have that prompt appear. 💸 We hope this helps you make a little extra cash (and avoid those awkward conversations!).

Update: Client Statements
If you’re someone who works with client Statements in Jane, this one might make you go, “ooh!” and maybe even, “ahh!”. These small but mighty updates will be great for everyone, but we hope they’re especially helpful for our friends in the U.S. who deal with insurance. 💪
Here’s what’s new:
👀 We’ve
moved the Summary to the top
of the Statement, so it’s above all the nitty-gritty details. This way, you and your clients will be able to see the most important info at-a-glance.
🧾 Speaking of nitty-gritty details, we’ve added a
new filter option: Exclude Insurance Details
which will remove all the insurance bits and bobs (like CPT codes, ICD10 codes, co-pay, etc.) to help keep your Statements from being longer than a CVS receipt.
📫 For anyone who sends their Statements in the mail, we’ve also added a
Print (Mail) option
so the client’s name and address will
fit into the window of a #10 envelope
when folded!
We hope these changes are helpful for you and your clients!
Improvements
Chart Entries
: We’ve added a new Filter option that allows you to sort a client’s Chart Entries by newest first or oldest first! Then, if you go to Export the chart, it will print or create a PDF in the order you’ve chosen.
Language Settings
: Jane is learning a new language! You can now search using Japanese characters and, if you head to Clinic Info & Locations and set your locale to Japan, Jane will translate some key parts of your account into Japanese (including your Online Booking site). Arigatou to our clinic in Japan for their patience and assistance with this. 🙏
Memberships
: We made Memberships a bit more flexible. You can now apply a Membership to an appointment even if the billing cycle for that appointment time is unpaid! Jane will give you a friendly heads up but will allow you and your clients to book any eligible sessions regardless.
Write-Offs
: We’ve taken a cue from Missy Elliot and worked it so that you can now take a
partially
written-off invoice, flip it and reverse it. This will revert the invoice back to the initial balance, saving you a step in the process.
Fixes
Wait List Notifications
: A bug was causing staff members’ post-treatment time to be added on top of a treatment’s scheduled time when a client claimed a spot on the Wait List. We politely asked the little nuisance to pack its things and go, so there shouldn’t be any more treatment length confusion for your Wait List clients.
Intake Forms
: We’ve fixed up an issue where Intake Forms that still need to be completed weren’t appearing in clients’
My Account
. Now, your clients should be able to log in and see their pending Intake Forms (and hopefully complete them 😉).

Changelog: May 30th, 2022
Update: Jane Payments Cut-Off Time
The new cutoff time for
Jane Payments
is 11:59 pm ET / 8:59 pm PT.
🎉
This means that all payments processed before 11:59 pm for our East Coasters and 8:59 pm for those of us out West will be deposited into your account at the same time. Say goodbye to having payments from the same calendar day split into two deposits on two separate days! We hope this helps make your bookkeeping a little easier.
New: Settings Search Bar 🔎
Over the years, as Jane has grown up, our Settings list has grown too. So, we’ve introduced a search bar to help you quickly find what you’re looking for! Right now, you’ll need to type in the specific Settings tab you’d like to pull up, but soon you’ll be able to type in keywords for whatever you’re looking to do and Jane will show you where to go! Pretty neat, hey?
Update: Formatting for Phrases
You can now
add formatting
to your Phrases: Create a list, include some links, or even add a little
emphasis
! You can add or edit Phrases from your Staff profile. Learn all about
using phrases for faster charting here
!
Improvements
Passwords
: You know when you’re typing in a password and you think you’ve made a typo so you have to delete everything and start over? Well, you won’t have to do that in Jane anymore! We’ve added the
option
to make your password visible as you type it in, so you can create super long, complex passwords and not worry about entry errors. 💪
Insurance Policy Reset
: We’ve added a little extra info to the policy reset confirmation screen to explain the criteria for resetting a policy. We’ve also updated the success message when policies are reset to show the number of insurance policies that were reset, instead of just displaying the total number of policies that were selected.
Insurance Info on Intake Forms
: Did you know clients can’t upload their insurance info to an intake form as a PDF? We realized that wasn’t super clear, so we’ve added a note to the upload area so clients know which file types
can
be uploaded (jpeg, jpg, and png). To make sure the message is loud and clear, we’ve added that info to the error message someone will see if they try to upload an incompatible file as well.
🇨🇦
TELUS eClaims
: Registered Social Workers and Occupational Therapists are now able to submit claims through Jane’s TELUS eClaims integration!

Jane Payments
: We’ve redesigned the Settings area so that everything you need to know or take action on is easier to find in fewer clicks.
Time Zones
: For anyone using Jane’s ‘Display Clinic Time Zone’ feature, we’ve continued to add to the list of places that Jane will display Time Zones for clients, including on Wait List Requests!
Arrive/No Show
: You click Arrive so many times a day (and No Show hopefully a little less), so every extra second you spend waiting for Jane to turn that appointment green (or red) counts! We’ve made some behind-the-scenes updates to make that process speedier than ever, and we hope it saves you a little extra time each day.
Client Sign-up Form
: We’ve improved the order we displayed First Name, Last Name, Preferred Name, and Pronouns on the client sign-up form.
🇺🇸
Claim Submission Folders
: We added a fancy new ‘Related Claims’ section to the Claim Summary panel in your Claim Submission Folders. Now, when you click View on a primary claim in any submission folder, you can scroll down and see if the client also has secondary coverage (and vice versa!).
Fixes
Return Visit Reminders
: Jane was having some trouble with time management and wasn’t sending out RVRs that were scheduled on the same day they were set to send. We’ve fixed that up now and your reminders will be sent, no matter when you’re scheduling them.
Wait List Notifications
: We trapped a bug that was causing Wait List Notification cues to pop up for appointments scheduled outside of shifts. We’ve shooed that little pest out the window and they will only appear for appointments within a shift from now on.
Products
: Occasionally, if someone changed the quantity of a product being sold really quickly, Jane had a little trouble keeping the inventory up-to-date. We’ve introduced a little extra caffeine to the morning routine, and Jane now has all the necessary energy to track even the quickest of clickers!

🚀  Wait List Notifications
The wait for better Wait List management is over! Wait List Notifications will hold any cancelled, deleted, no-showed, or moved appointment times for your Wait List clients whose availability and preferences fit within that spot. Then, you’ll be able to send all those clients an SMS and/or Email notification, book in a specific client, or release the spot back to the general public.
If you enable automatic notifications, you can sit back and relax while Jane manages your Wait List for you! We hope this helps you keep your schedules full and see your clients sooner.

Disciplines
: Everyone please say a warm welcome to some new friends… we’ve added

TELUS eClaims
: We’ve also added the
Nova Scotia College of Audiologists and Speech-Language Pathologists
as a selectable licensing body for TELUS eClaims!
🇺🇸
U.S. Claim Submission Folders
:
Claims in the
Approved and Search folders
will now be shown in
descending
order by service date, meaning you’ll see your most recent claims at the top! Say, ‘see ya later’ to those old claims you’ve been seeing for so long.
We also added a new
Claim Type
filter so it’s super easy to find all those secondary claims (or filter them out so you can just select primaries!).
Fixes
Charting
: We searched high and low and found a pesky bug that would clear a Chart Entry if a practitioner used
Google translate
in the charting area. We can’t promise Jane will always understand what you’re saying, but if you choose to translate directly in your charts, the entry will stay intact.
🇨🇦
TELUS eClaims
: Some
claim reversal requests
(particularly for Desjardins) were being rejected due to rounding of cents in the total billed amount. It turns out every penny really does count! We’ve sorted that out and it won’t hold up your claim reversals any longer.
🔝

Changelog: April 4th, 2022
Improvements
Timezones
: You can now update your Online Booking Settings to display your clinic timezone for your clients! Your timezone acronym (like PST, EST) will appear on your Online Booking site and in all appointment-related emails. We hope this helps avoid miscommunications for anyone working with clients outside of your timezone!
The Compensation Report
: Some of you were asking for an easier way to understand how Jane was arriving at the commission value totals shown within this report, so we updated the exported version to include a per-line breakdown of commission rates, subtotals, and totals. This update will also provide additional flexibility for clinics that may want to perform their own calculations on the compensation data!
Setting up your Jane Account
: We’ve added the ability for Account Owners to easily navigate back to Optional Tasks in the Onboarding Wizard in case you want to redo them. Thanks to everyone who requested this small change that we hope will make a big impact on how you learn to use Jane. 💙
Fixes
Locations
: If you’ve ever gotten lost with a map in your hand, you’ll know how Jane was feeling recently. For a while, the map in the Clinic Locations Settings wasn’t updating to match the address that was typed in. We’ve got this all fixed up now!

Improvements
Memberships
: We haven’t quite figured out time travel yet, but Jane has! You can now
backdate
a Membership when you sell it, and Jane will generate all the past billing cycle invoices accordingly. In keeping with the number one rule of time travel, these past invoices won’t be processed automatically to avoid any expensive surprises in the present (or future 😉).
Refunds
: We found that lots of bookkeeping headaches were happening due to payment refunds accidentally being edited
and
that it’s pretty rare that someone actually needs to do that. So, we’ve removed the option to edit, and if you ever need to do so, the Jane team will be more than happy to hop in and help you out.
🇨🇦
Canadian Insurance Integrations
: Jane pulled out the ol’ label maker and got busy. You’ll find some new insurer labels that help you see integrations (like Pacific Blue Cross, Teleplan, and TELUS eClaims) at-a-glance when saving a new Insurance Policy.
Fixes
Receipts
: Sometimes, the detailed receipts would show ‘Credit Card’ when an Interac Debit card was used, so we’ve fixed that up to make sure all your receipts are accurate.
🇨🇦
Teleplan
: Jane was having a bit of trouble submitting Teleplan claims from a client’s Insurance Policy area. We fixed that up, so you can once again submit your Teleplan claims from wherever works best for you.

Improvements
Jane Payments:
Some of the
French translations
in our Jane Payments area were… pas bon. We signed Jane up for Duolingo, and hopefully Jane parle mieux le français maintenant.
It looks like Jane’s putting that Duolingo to good use because you can now
search Clients and Staff
using
non-Latin alphabets,
like Japanese and Chinese!
Privacy & Security:
We made Jane a little bit safer by requiring your password before you can change your
Mobile Phone Number
in your Staff Profile (and the same for Clients in their My Account!). Just another layer of security to keep your accounts safe and sound.
🇺🇸
Electronic Claim Submission:
Our clinics located in the
US Virgin Islands and other US territories
can now submit claims electronically!
🇺🇸
U.S. Insurance Submission Folders:
After receiving some feedback that you were missing the
at-a-glance
ability to check if billing codes had been added to an appointment, we added two new columns to the Claim Submission folders:
Procedures & Diagnosis Codes.
This will make it easier to spot claims that don’t yet have Diagnosis codes or CPT codes added!
Fixes
My Account:
Jane was being a little inconsistent about requiring
home or mobile phone numbers
from Clients when they signed up online. We’ve got that sorted out now, so either a mobile
or
home phone number will be needed.
Privacy & Security:
We snuck in another small security win by
hiding client names that were exposed in the URL
when searching for a Client Profile.
Class Bookings:
We zapped an annoying little bug that was causing any Class Booking placed beside a shift that was set to a “Not Bookable Online” to
also
not be bookable online.

🇺🇸 U.S. Insurance Billing: Claim Submission Folder Update
For all our practices in the U.S. that bill insurance, you’ll notice that your
Claim Submission folders
have gotten a makeover. The core functionality hasn’t changed, but there are a few changes that we know will make your insurance billing go so much smoother.
There’s a new Claim Summary panel that shows you everything you need to know about a claim at-a-glance. We’ve added checkboxes that you can use to select your claims for submission and a summary at the bottom of the page to show you how many you’ve chosen, from how many different insurers, and whether they’re primary or secondary claims. We’ve also moved the big orange submit button from the top of the screen to the bottom right, for a more intuitive experience. 🎉 Let us know what you think!
Improvements
My Account
: We’ve updated the Documents section of your Client’s My Account to display files in order from newest to oldest. For your clients, this means no more scrolling through dozens of surveys to find the info you’ve just shared! A small but mighty change. 💪
Memberships
: We realized the way we initially set Memberships up was a little restrictive, so we’ve made some tweaks to allow you to redeem them for past appointments. This way, if a Membership accidentally gets removed or is missed for an appointment, you can go back and apply it as needed.
Class Booking
: Previously, if a client booked into a class through your Online Booking site, Jane didn’t update your admin Schedule until the booking was completely finalized. Now, the class booking will update in real-time as soon as a client initiates the booking process so that there’s no chance of overbooking your class.

: We’ve given Full Access users the ability to delete system (clinic-wide) chart templates like, for example, that SOAP note no one is using anymore.
🇺🇸
New Insurance Policies
: Previously, if a ‘Date of Current Illness, Injury, or Pregnancy’ had been added to an insurance policy, we didn’t
require
that you select a date type. If no date type was selected, we assumed it was an ‘Onset of Current Symptoms of Illness’ date when generating claim submissions. To help with the accuracy of your submissions moving forward, we’ll require that the date type is selected before saving new insurance policies that have a ‘Date of Current Illness, Injury, or Pregnancy’.
Fixes
Packages
and
Memberships
: We’ve updated the way Jane copies appointments on the Schedule. Now, if you Copy an appointment that is part of a Package or Membership that your client has purchased, it will only be transferred to the next appointment if it hasn’t expired by that future date.
Emails
: We’ve got Jane practicing more gratitude! The customizable “Thanks for choosing us” text that was previously appearing for only
some
automated emails will now appear on
all
emails. Full Access users can edit this by heading to the Language section of your Settings and editing the “Phrases: Thanks For Choosing” message.
🇺🇸
ICD10 Code Set
: We did some early Spring cleaning of the ICD10 Code Set. 🧹 We’ve added any codes we missed in our last update and swept away any old, deprecated codes. While there might still be a few dust bunnies we’re working on, all active codes are now included in the code set.

Changelog: February 7th, 2022
🇨🇦 Sun Life Financial says goodbye to TELUS eClaims
Sun Life Financial claims are no longer accepted through TELUS eClaims as of
January 30th
.
This change means that all practice management vendors, like Jane, that are integrated with TELUS eClaims will no longer be able to direct bill to Sun Life. Instead, we’ll all have to use Sun Life’s stand-alone portal.
We’re easing this transition by updating your Sun Life (TELUS eClaims) insurers and their associated insurance policies from
integrated electronic submissions
to
portal billing,
as well as preventing any new Sun Life (TELUS eClaims) insurers from being created.
Improvements
Client List Report:
We added ‘
Referring Professional Phone Number’
to the exported version of this report! This is a nice little stepping stone along the path to making your Client List Report the most complete and useful it can be.
Keyboard Shortcuts:
They say there are no shortcuts in life, but there sure are in Jane! And we’ve just added 2 more. Hitting ‘
K
’ on your keyboard will now bring up your Task list and using ‘
Shift + ?
’ will pull up the full list of keyboard shortcuts that are available.
Choosing a Secure Password:
We’ve added a helpful resource to the Practitioner Profile setup to help you learn how to create a secure password.
🇬🇧
U.K. Insurance:
We’ve updated a few insurance terms to match the lingo used on your side of the pond.
🇺🇸
Staff Billing Settings:
We improved the design of the Staff Billing Settings by switching the
optional
Billing Settings from checkboxes to expandable chevrons. This should keep things feeling a little tidier as you scroll through.
Fixes
Insurance Info on Intake Forms:
Briefly, clients weren’t able to move past the Insurance Information step of an Intake Form if they had selected ‘Self’ as the Relationship to Insured
and
the Intake Form was set to require the Insured Person’s Details/Address. We’ve explained why that’s a touch illogical to Jane, and clients will once again be able to fill out their forms as expected.
Chart Items:
If you chart with multiple Body Charts, one after another, you may have noticed a bit of musical Body Charts going on when you upload a new image. We’ve told Jane there’s a time and place for dancing, and it’s not in your Chart Entries, so those should stay put from now on.
Intake Forms:
Folks were finding that some of their Intake Forms were rearranging themselves as well. We’ve fixed that up, and they should once again be appearing in the correct order.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: January 24th, 2022
Improvements
Locations
: We’ve added a drop-down menu to the Locations screen that will let you choose to view your
active
Locations or
archived
Locations. We also added a reminder there to save your changes while creating or editing a Location, because who doesn’t need a little nudge to save their work sometimes?
Welcome Emails
and
Password Reset Emails
: We’ve made an update to the links included in these emails to enhance the security of your Jane account. Now, once a client or colleague has clicked the link to update their password, the link will expire and they won’t be able to use it again.
Fixes
Sketch pad:
We found an issue where notes created on the sketch pad were being cut off when you went to download or print a Chart Entry. We’ve asked Jane to respect your masterpieces, so your sketch pad notes should remain intact from now on.
Intake Forms:
Client signatures were occasionally not appearing once a client had completed their Intake Form. We’ve fixed that up, and all forms that require signatures should display them moving forward.
Schedule:
A pesky little bug had us seeing double…
double-booking
, that is. An appointment would appear as if it had been double-booked when placed immediately after an existing appointment. We’ve asked that bug to step in line, and your Schedule should be back to normal.
Rooms
: We asked Jane to pump the breaks when someone tries to delete a room that has future appointments booked into it. This way, there’s no chance of someone’s Schedule getting messy if a Room is deleted before appointments are relocated.
🇨🇦
TELUS eClaims:
We found an issue where submissions for La Capitale and Coughlin & Associates were being rejected. We’ve patched that up, and you’ll be able to submit your claims without issue.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: January 10th, 2022
Improvements
We added a friendly reminder to the
Treatment Settings
to Save your work before moving on. It’s a reminder we wish we had more often, so we figured that you might too!
We increased the number of characters you can use for your
Ratings and Reviews Google Prompt
from 255 to 500, so now you can customize to your heart’s content.
🇺🇸 We’ve improved our
ERA Management Tool!
Now, Jane will include any claim-level adjustments that might be included on a claim response, rather than just the individual billing code adjustments (which are the norm!).
Fixes
Clinic Locations
had become a bit stubborn about the order they were appearing in your Settings. We’ve reminded them who’s boss, and you can once again arrange them however you’d like.
For a while, Jane was allowing appointments to be reserved outside a shift when ‘
prevent staff booking outside of shifts
’ was turned on and the appointment was Copied and placed there. We did a bit of spackling, and Copied appointments won’t be slipping through the cracks anymore.
🇨🇦 The
“Check Eligibility”
button was appearing for all TELUS eClaims, even insurers that don’t actually accept them… whoops! We’ve patched that up, so now only claims under insurers that
do
in fact accept these submissions will show the option to do an eligibility check.
🔝

Changelog: December 20th, 2021
Memberships
We know a lot of you have been patiently waiting for this one (974, officially!), so we’re very happy to be able to say: you can now
create Memberships and collect recurring payments
in Jane!
Once you’ve created your Memberships, you can sell them to your clients to be billed on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis. If a client has a credit card on file, you can choose to have Jane charge them automatically. Other payment methods can be accepted manually. We’re hoping this feature will save you time and maybe even make you a little extra cash.
Improvements
We tweaked the way Jane creates an invoice to ensure that an
Insurer’s Legal Name
(instead of the Internal Name you’ve given it) is displayed.
Packages
will now be carried over when you Copy an appointment! This should save you a few extra clicks, especially if you’re booking several appointments out in advance.
For any clinics out there that have Staff members who practice
multiple disciplines
, we’ve asked Jane to clean up how and where those Staff appear on the main Schedule.
We made it a little easier to turn off
Ratings & Reviews
. While we’re always trying to make sure the i’s are dotted and t’s are crossed, we don’t want you to have to jump through hoops just to hit the off button.
We gave the
Need Help
section (in the top right corner of your Jane account) a complete makeover to make it even easier for you to get in touch whenever you need us.
Fixes
We discovered an issue where Jane was allowing
payments to be unapplied more than once.
This usually happened when you were trying to delete a big (like really big) payment and, while waiting for Jane to mull it over, perhaps hit that trash can button a few extra times. We’ve asked Jane to put a lid on the trash can while she’s thinking, so you shouldn’t run into this issue anymore.
A little bug was causing the
Treatments list
under a Staff member’s name on the Schedule to stay open even though the Staff member was deselected. We’ve swatted it away, and that list should once again tuck itself away when you don’t need to see it.
We’ve updated the Dashboard that appears in your Settings to factor in
Daylight Savings.
Turns out that time change was just as hard on Jane as it was on our sleep schedules. Go figure.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: December 6th, 2021
🇺🇸 Introducing CMS1500 support for Secondary Claims!
If you look at an appointment with two insurance policies added, you’ll now see an option in the Pay drop-down menu to generate a CMS1500 for the
Primary
or
Secondary
claim. This is
phase 1
of our plan to
support Secondary Claims in Jane
.
We’re now moving onto
phase 2
, which involves some adjustments to the Claim Submission folders to make it really easy to visualize and track Secondary Claims. After that, we’ll move onto
phase 3,
which will introduce support for
electronic submissions to secondaries
.
Intake Forms just got a little more organized
We’ve updated the way you can view and manage your patient’s Intake Forms from their patient profile! At-a-glance, you can see the name and status of their 5 most recent Intake Forms, and then you can click to expand the list if you’d like to view older forms (with unsubmitted at the top and submitted forms at the bottom).
When you click the three dots to the right of each Intake Form, you have the option to change the patient associated with the form or delete it altogether (as long as it hasn’t been signed; the account owner is still the only one who can delete a signed Intake Form).
Choose your favourite Chart Items and Templates
We had a lot of you requesting the ability to choose the Chart Items and Templates that appear in the dropdown menu under the
New Chart Entry
button, so this one is for all of you! You can now click the star next to your favourite Items and Templates to customize the options that appear in your dropdown menu. We hope this helps make your charting even easier and speedier!
📍
Update
(December 9th, 2021): After receiving some feedback from our community, we’ve decided to return to the previous design of the Chart Templates and Items area for now. We appreciate everyone who reached out with feedback, and we love working with you to make Jane the best it can be. If you’d like to contribute to our planning for how this area will change in the future, please
reach out to us
or add a
Feature Request
to our board.
Improvements
We’ve added the ability for you to hide your Location Address from appearing on your Online Booking site and patient email communication. Stealth mode engaged. 👀
We added Reflexology to the Discipline list found in Settings!
🇺🇸 Jane’s insurance billing got even more flexible last week, with the addition of a new setting to Staff Billing Settings:
Bill Under a Different Name or Rendering Provider?
This will make a few things easier: (1) working with students or new grads, (2) when you see a patient at the same time as another practitioner, or (3) if you need to bill under your full legal name, but use a different name with your patients.
🇺🇸 We added the Insurer Name to the list of details presented when linking an
Unlinked Claim Response
to its rightful claim. This will make it easier to find when Jane can’t link the claim response automatically, especially if a patient has a primary and secondary policy.
Fixes
We discovered an email translation that was showing up in some intimidating code speak. We promise the robots are not planning their uprising (quite yet), and the wording should be back to normal now. 🤖
We found and fixed an issue where
Clinical Surveys
were occasionally not being sent out.
When working with the Schedule, if
Copy or Move
had been selected, Jane was getting a bit stubborn about finishing that task before doing anything else. We’ve reminded Jane who the boss is, and you should once again be able to do other things as you go to Copy or Move an appointment.
We found a pesky issue where the
Ratings & Reviews settings
would sporadically reset. If you had any trouble with Review emails sending, we suggest double-checking to make sure they’re set up as you’d like them. We’ve made sure Jane won’t continue to misbehave.
🔝

Changelog: November 22, 2021
Insurer-Specific Modifiers
🇺🇸
This one is for our U.S. community: You can now set
insurer-specific modifiers
instead of having to add modifiers to every single appointment! From your Billing Settings, you can set up
default modifiers
for any insurers that need them. Less manual entry = fewer rejections (and hopefully fewer grey hairs as well)!
Improvements
You can now add a
New Patient
profile from the
Wait List
, the same way you can from the Appointment Panel. Go ahead and take a quick stretch break, because you just gained some time back in your day!
We’ve tweaked the
Ratings and Reviews Settings
page so that we don’t ask if you’d like to “
Select all treatments
” if you haven’t opted in any Staff members who offer those treatments.
We’ve made a little change to the
Pay Balance Email
to help you feel confident in the way you are asking your customers for money (it’s a difficult enough conversation as it is!). Now, you’ll be able to see a preview of what your client will see before you send it.
🇺🇸 When submitting insurance claims electronically, Jane now lets you know (and throws up a roadblock) if you’ve selected any secondary claims in your batch. Jane isn’t able to support electronic submission to secondary payers… yet! We’re working on a feature to allow for secondary submissions as we speak.
🇺🇸 We’ve added an option when creating a CPT code to include the description (label) in electronic and paper claim submissions. This unlocks the option for you to
bill Unlisted Services/Procedures
through Jane.
Fixes
We caught a bug that was nibbling on the Schedule: you’ll once again be able to select certain Staff to view using the
plus icon
while also filtering by discipline.
One of our favourite Chart Items,
the sketch pad
, was acting… well, a tiny bit
sketchy
… If you were using Safari, dots wouldn’t appear, but we’ve found the issue, and it’s once again behaving as expected.
We fixed an issue on the Schedule for anyone using Jane on mobile. The banner that prompts you to ‘
Tap and Hold
’ if you’d like to book an appointment was popping up and hanging around a little longer than expected. The banner will once again appear and disappear in a timely manner.
Some of the hyperlinks in the Patient Profile Notes area were redirecting users to, well, nowhere (like in Credit Memos and Packages). We’ve patched those up so we’re not sending you waywardly into the link abyss.
🔝

Changelog: November 8, 2021
Updates to Collecting Insurance Information on Intake Forms
As part of our mission to make insurance billing as smooth as possible in Jane, we’ve made another exciting update to our recently released
insurance information collection feature
. You’re now able to specify whether you want to collect the
primary policy holder’s
(ie. your client’s, or their spouse’s or parent’s)
personal details, address, or both: you let Jane know which details you’d like to collect, and Jane will provide the appropriate fields to do so. If your client selects anything other than ‘self’ for ‘Relationship to Insured’, new fields will appear to collect those details as well. This information will all automatically populate into your client’s insurance policies, awaiting your review.
Improvements
We tweaked the
Schedule
for
mobile devices
so you no longer have to tap twice in order to select a staff member.
If you were entering a
New Insurer Payment
from the
Insurer Invoices
area, you may have noticed that Jane was setting the default $ value to the
total amount
that was owed by that insurer. We like to be optimistic here at Jane, but that might be a bit too optimistic. We’ve told Jane to default the $ value to zero and let you enter what the insurer has actually paid.
We added some language translations to the
Ratings & Reviews
settings page.
🇺🇸 We added a
View Claim Response(s)
option in the Insurance Info section of the Appointment Panel and Purchases screen. Going forward, if a claim is connected to a claim response and you want to view or edit the EOB for the appointment, we recommend using this new option instead of ‘Edit EOB’ so you can see the remittance details.
🇨🇦 We hid
Alberta Blue Cross
as a TELUS eClaims insurer option for clinics in Alberta since only providers
outside of Alberta
are able to submit their Alberta Blue Cross claims through TELUS eClaims. Yep, we hear how that sounds! 🙃
Fixes
We caught a bug that was causing some of your Sketch Chart Entries to get a little cut-off.
When deleting Chart Entries from the Staff Profile, Jane was sending a
Not Found Error message
once the deed was done. But… you know, that was kind of the whole point of deleting it, so maybe a mission accomplished message would have been more accurate? We’ve removed the message altogether to help avoid any confusion in the future.
We brought back the camera icon for
Online Appointments
displayed in the Staff List. 📹
Jane was giving some users a little light sass when they tried to
delete a Patient Profile
that a File had been added to and then deleted from. Now, once all Files are deleted the Profile can be removed without any backtalk.
We’ve fixed an issue where, when copying and pasting something from Word into a Chart Entry, Jane was pasting the title of the Word document in there as well.
🇨🇦 In an attempt to help our clinics submit successful insurance claims, we may have made things a little
too
restrictive. 😳 We’ve loosened up a little, so if a claim is in a ‘no submission required’ state, you can once again edit billing and diagnosis codes. Go ahead, call us a helicopter practice management software, we deserve it.

Changelog: October 22nd, 2021
Update to Staff Social Media Logins
As part of our ongoing effort to protect the privacy and security of our clinics, we made a small change to
staff logins
. Staff members who exclusively
have a social media login
(Google, Facebook, Twitter) associated with their account
will now be prompted to create a standalone username and password
. This adds a layer of security to verify that it’s really you attempting to change sensitive information on your account. If you haven’t seen it already, we love
this webcomic
. It’s a great reminder that
strong
passwords don’t have to be hard to remember.
Improvements
We added a direct link to book a
New Account Set Up
call to the Onboarding Wizard for clinics that are still getting acquainted with Jane and could use a little help from our support team.
We made Jane
go a little faster when opening an appointment
from the schedule. This is a small performance step per appointment, but a giant leap for appointment-kind. 🌕
When working in
Patient Privacy Mode
(Shift+P) patient personal information will now also be obfuscated in the Reports area.
Instead of automatically arriving Online Appointments when a client arrives in the new
Waiting Room
, Jane now
lets you choose when to arrive the appointment
. Jane is helpful, but never bossy.
In true
you can’t change the past
fashion, you’ll now see a handy error message if you try updating an appointment on the schedule that has already been deleted.
Before deleting a claim that is linked to a remittance claim response, Jane now double checks if you
really
want to delete it. 🇺🇸
Fixes
After a brief break from being considered, rescheduled breaks are once again included in the
Hours Scheduled/Booked
Report.
We fixed an issue where Jane would sometimes display a different payment method other than the one you had just clicked on when processing a refund. In other words, we put the “fun” back in refund.
The instruction chart part was not following formatting instructions and would collapse
multipleparagraphstogether
. They should now be spaced out appropriately with an adequate amount of breathing room.
Some clinics reported an occasional hiccup when trying to load the
Insurer Invoices > Purchases
list under the Billing Tab. In true Halloween spirit, we put on a bedsheet with some cutout holes and successfully scared off those hiccups. 👻
Some things age well, like wine or one of those fancy cheeses. Others don’t age as gracefully… like insured appointments. While this only affected a handful of our most seasoned clinics, no one should experience trouble loading old insured appointments going forward. 🧀
Keyboard shortcuts
were not working from the Day sheet. Shortcuts are once again following their ⌘CMDs (commands— sorry Windows users, Apple joke) may once again hop to your schedule (Shift + 1) or double book (D key) with ease.
Accounts Owners who are also practitioners assigned to a Discipline will now be directed to the practitioner view when tapping the Schedule tab.
Folks were finding that they couldn’t copy or move appointments between the Day and Schedule Tabs. Appointments can now hop fluidly between views.
There was a small quirk that made filtering the electronic Remittances list challenging, especially if there were a large number of them in the folder. This should be much more manageable now. 🇺🇸
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: October 8th, 2021
Additional Profile Security
We have introduced an additional level of security to the profiles of staff members and patients that protects the information used to verify identity. All staff are now required to enter their password before updating their own — or another staff member’s — contact information. When a patient updates their own contact information via the
My Account
page, they will now have to enter their password before making changes.
ICD10 Code Set 2022 Update
🇺🇸
The ICD10 code set — which can be found in
Settings > Billing Codes
— has been updated to reflect
CMS’s 2022 changes
that took effect on October 1st. Valid diagnosis codes from 2021 that are now deprecated in the 2022 update have been removed from Jane’s ICD10 code set. Likewise, all replacement codes and new codes have been added. Learn more in our ICD10 FAQ
here
.
Improvements
We made some small tweaks to the styling of
Resources
on the schedule to improve things for clinics that use several Resources for appointment bookings.
We added a handy
guide
reference to help all new staff create a secure password when setting up their Jane account for the first time.
We added a new description to the Online Booking
post-treatment time
— which can be found in the Staff profile under
Edit/Settings > Online Booking
— to help practitioners better understand how to setup their schedule.
We made
Wait List
items update instantaneously when viewing the schedule. You can now see updates to the Wait List made by patients or other practitioners in real time! Sweet, sweet automation!
We made a small tweak to the drop-down options in the
Create a New Treatment
workflow. This change lays down the foundation for some exciting updates to Treatments that are coming down the line. Specifically, support for
Grouped Appointments
!
For our Canadian clinics, we have added TELUS eClaims support for
Alberta Blue Cross
. A friendly heads up that Alberta Blue Cross
only allows submissions via TELUS eClaims for those outside of Alberta
(we recognize that this sounds a bit strange!). 🇨🇦
For our Canadian clinics, Jane is now better equipped to handle situations where a bad or malformed response is received from
TELUS
or the insurer. This was previously causing pages (invoices, purchases, etc.) in Jane associated with the bad response to become inaccessible. Submissions with good and bad responses are now always accessible. 🇨🇦
Jane’s Polish Community - świętować!
Clinics in Poland
can now sign up for a
Jane Payments
(through Stripe) and start processing payments.  🇵🇱
We’ve added some missing
German translations
to receipts. Wunderbar! 🇩🇪
Fixes
Resending the right intake form
- Jane was sending
intake forms
for any expired forms, which caused some confusion. Now, Jane only resends the expired form if it’s required, or if your patient has an upcoming appointment.
The
Return Visit Reminder
(RVR) button wasn’t cooperating when accessed from the List View version of the Schedule after no-showing an appointment. It’s now cooperating and will direct you to the RVR form lickety-split when clicked.
We patched a hole that allowed
treatments on Wait List items
to be carried over when clinics changed the practitioner offering a different discipline.
Our
Ratings & Reviews
feature was accidentally blocking folks from selecting treatments assigned to a Discipline set to Not Bookable Online. We relaxed the rules here to ensure all treatments can be enabled for a Ratings email, regardless of the online booking policy.
The
“Reschedule an Appointment”
mode was triggered on mobile devices when scrolling on top of an appointment on the Schedule. Clinics can scroll easy knowing that they won’t accidentally move an appointment to another day.
The summary section of the
Applied & Unapplied (A&UP)
report was missing the first date of the selected date range in its calculations. The values should make sense now!
The
Onboarding Wizard
has undergone some improvements including a change that will allow users to freely navigate throughout Jane without the wizard popping in and out.
We noticed that some clinics were running into a blue sad-face error when
entering a very large price
for a product (over a hundred million dollars). Well, we’ve turned that frown upside down by adding a little message that gives you a heads up that you’ve probably entered the wrong price.
The price field was showing up blank on the
Edit Product form
for certain locales. Folks who use Euros as their currency should be able to see prices properly now when making changes to products. 🇬🇧

Knock-Knock feature for Online Appointments

Insurance Card Photos can now be set to Optional
After receiving some great feedback from the community on our new
Insurance Information
Intake Form feature, we’ve introduced a preference that makes uploading an insurance card photo optional instead of required.
Customize the information you collect from New Clients
You can now tailor the
client sign up page
in our new
Settings > Client Form Fields
area to ensure you’re capturing the client information you need. This is also the place where you can enable
Pronoun
collection for your clients who book their appointments online.
Improvements
We’ve given the
Ratings and Review
set up page a new look to make it easier to navigate. We’d love to know what you think — send us a message if you have any thoughts!
We’ve prettied up the way
lists are formatted in chart entries
by removing some of the indentation.
We added a
sticky save bar in the Settings area
to remind you to save you changes before leaving.
We’ve introduced some
additional translations
for pronouns labels in Danish, German, English, Spanish, Estonian, French, Italian, Dutch, and Portuguese.
We also
updated some Danish language
for the Online Booking site. Shoutout to our newest Danish clinic for helping out with these translations!
Our team added a few
new videos
and helpful tips to improve the
onboarding
experience for new practitioners joining Jane for the first time.
Fixes
The
chart status icon
🔒 on the appointment in the day sheet was out of sync when changing / removing the linked appointment in a chart. I guess you could say the lock was not in lockstep but we got a lock on the issue, fastened a fix, and got the issue locked down.
Corrected our staff member defaults so that practitioners can see
breaks
on their schedule unless otherwise specified.
Administrative staff with Practitioner / Front Desk access can once again manage their own
shifts
. We see the irony in administrative staff not be able to administer their own shifts…
Fixed a bug that caused Jane to link
tasks
to the author rather than the assignee. Authors of Tasks can once again link tasks to other staff members, instead of only being able to assign them to themselves. You know what they say… when you want something done right, do it yourself…
We ensured clients who have a Jane account open in
multiple tabs on their browser
don’t run into issues when booking appointments online. Your clients can now go tab crazy and confidently book their appointments.

Intake Forms
:
There’s a new
consent disclaimer
at the beginning of intake forms to help patients understand how their info is saved.
You can now
mass de-select
profile field values in the intake form builder, making it much quicker when creating or editing templates.
Fixes
🇺🇸 Insurance

“Not found” errors
when applying payments to invoices.

🇺🇸 🇨🇦
Reserve with Google
Patients and clients can now book with you right from their Google search results. 🔍
Jane’s new
Reserve with Google integration
makes it easier for people to find you and schedule an appointment without needing to click through to your website. It’s a quick way to boost your online visibility and bring more patients through your door.
Here’s how it works:
When someone finds your clinic on
Google Search
or
Maps
, they’ll now see a
“Book now”
button.
That button takes them directly to your
Jane online booking site
, making it simple to schedule an appointment in just a few clicks.
You can set this up by connecting your
Google Business Profile
with your
Jane online booking site
.
Improvements
Secure Messaging
: Messages are now saved automatically as drafts in your browser as you work. This means you can step away or accidentally close that tab (oops!) without losing what you wrote. (Psst… drafts don’t carry over between browsers or devices, so stick to the same screen if you’re working on something big!)
Jane Payments
: Patients will now get a
reminder to update expiring credit cards
on file as part of their regular appointment reminders. This should help catch expired cards ahead of time, keeping checkout quick and smooth.
Intake Forms
: We’ve made it easier to
rearrange the consents
in your intake forms. Now, you’ll see a handy little button next to each consent that lets you drag and drop them into the perfect order. Just don’t forget to hit Save after you’re done!
Fixes
Secure Messaging
: Your clinic’s language preferences are now take into account when sending patient email notifications about new messages.
Patient Profile
: We fixed an issue that caused client names to not show up when editing a Group they are part of.
Intake Forms
:
We noticed that uploaded insurance cards weren’t showing up in the right places when multiple forms were submitted at the same time. Now, everything’s where it should be!
If you’ve ever adjusted the Marketing Emails opt-in text for your online booking page, we’ve fixed a temporary issue that prevented that text from carrying over to your intake forms.
To keep things crystal clear for your clients, we’ve added a
new consent disclaimer
at the very beginning of your intake forms. Now your clients will know exactly how and when their information is saved, right from the first step. Transparency for the win! 🎉
Schedule:
We tidied up a small issue that caused your appointments to appear squished over to the side when a note was added to it. Now your appointments won’t feel the squeeze. 🍋
Custom cancellation reasons won’t suddenly switch to “Other Reason” anymore. What you enter is what gets saved.
The location of upcoming appointments weren’t appearing in the My Account ever so briefly. That’s been taken care of, so there’s no more confusion!

Changelog: June 6, 2025
🇺🇸 Default CPT codes & improved ‘Copy Previous’
For our US clinics, we’ve rolled out two new updates to save you time (and clicks) when you’re billing the same codes over and over.
Here’s what’s new:
CPT Codes by Service:
Set your go-to CPT codes right at the treatment level. They’ll auto-fill when you book, saving you a few extra steps.
Copy Diagnosis Details:
Rebooking a client? You can now copy just the diagnosis or all billing details from a previous visit in a couple of clicks.
Learn more about setting up
Treatment-Specific CPT Codes
and
Re-booking Clients with the Same Insurance Info
in our guides.
Improvements
Secure Messaging (Beta):
You can now delete a message within 5 minutes of sending it, allowing you the time to quickly undo a mistake if needed (phew!).
Online Booking:
We fixed an issue affecting practitioners working across multiple locations, where patients saw empty sections for services not offered at certain locations. Now, your online booking site only shows what’s actually available, making the process clearer for patients. 🎉
Fixes
Intake Forms:
We’ve fixed an issue where patients with access to a related person’s payment card were getting stuck at the Credit Card step. Now, they should be able to submit their forms without trouble!
Bonus
✨ — we have more improvements coming to make this even smoother for patients with relationships enabled!
Phrases:
🇺🇸 Billing codes in Phrases weren’t showing up properly in the selection menu when adding them to your chart notes. We’ve cleaned that up, so now you’ll see your full Phrase exactly as it will appear in your chart entry.

Changelog: May 23, 2025
🇨🇦 Online Appointments in Jane’s Mobile App for Clients
For our Canadian clinics, Jane’s mobile app has a new update to help your patients and clients connect more easily. In addition to booking, checking, and managing their appointments, patients can now join Online Appointments (Telehealth) directly from the app.
When it’s time, they just tap “Join video call.” One tap, and they’re face-to-face with you. No switching tabs or searching through emails.
Learn more about joining an
Online Appointment in Jane’s mobile app
in our guide.
Improvements
🇬🇧
Healthcode (Beta):
We’ve made it easier to fix errors in batch claims by showing them in a simple, collapsed view. Less scrolling, more fixing! We also gave the View/Submit button in this workflow a little colour upgrade for better visual consistency.
🇬🇧
Localisation:
You’ll notice a new ‘English - UK’ option to select in Clinic Info > Location > Language, Currency & Numbers that ensures your default currency updates to GBP £, that the ‘Schedule’ is now called the ‘Diary,’ and gives you a Monday-Sunday week with a 24-hour clock. Cheers to that!
Fixes
Secure Messaging (Beta):
We’ve fixed up an issue that prevented line breaks (paragraphs) in longer messages from showing up. Beta testers flagged this one, and we’re happy to have it sorted! 🙌
🇺🇸
Eligibility Checks:
We’ve quickly fixed an issue that caused some fields to map incorrectly when sending checks to Claim.MD. No more mismatches!
Intake Forms:
Clicking ‘Load More’ in the online intake forms section of patient profiles wasn’t behaving—it is now!
Supervision:
We learned that when supervisees needed to make amendments on charts they’d created before having a supervisor assigned, they were unnecessarily requiring supervisor sign-off. We’ve fixed that!
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: May 2, 2025
Optional Signature Setting for Supervision
Jane’s Supervision feature now includes an
Optional Signature setting
! If enabled by their supervisor, Supervisees can decide, chart by chart, whether to request a supervisor’s signature or sign and lock the chart themselves.
This update is perfect for:
Clinics where not every note requires review.
Regulatory needs requiring only certain charts to be signed off.
Jurisdictions where some notes (e.g., SOAP) don’t need signatures, but treatment plans or discharge documents do.
Full Access users can enable this setting in supervisee staff profiles.
Learn more about Jane’s Supervision features in our guide.
Improvements:
🆕
Password Strength Checker:
We’re rolling out a new visual aid to help you create stronger passwords! Whether you’re creating or updating your password, this feature provides guidance on password strength but does not block you from using specific passwords if you wish.
Improved Help Chat Experience:
💬 We’ve made it easier to stay connected with Support while navigating your account! When you minimize an ongoing chat with Support, a draggable chat bubble will now appear at the bottom-right corner of your screen, allowing you to quickly resume the conversation. This feature works on most pages, excluding the Settings tab, for now.
Patient-Facing Permissions:
Patients deserve to feel confident about how their information is shared. That’s why we’ve made an update so that if you have relationships enabled for online booking, patients can now view, edit, or disconnect the permissions associated with their profile.
Fixes
Wait List:
The wait list display was looking a little squishy on mobile devices, so we’ve fixed that up and everything lines up nicely again.
Charting:
We’ve fixed an issue where amendment signatures were incorrectly triggering the “edit and re-sign” footer timestamp used in Supervision workflows. We’ve fixed that up so the amendment timestamp hangs out in the chart body for reference.
Intake Forms:
Staff with the right permissions can once again update the assigned patient on intake form submissions—smooth and easy, just like it should be!
No more déjà vu! We’ve fixed the issue where intake forms were showing up as duplicates in the “Online Intake Forms” section of a patient’s profile in some scenarios.
We fixed an issue that was causing the required insurance photo upload fields and the “Add Additional Policy” button on some patient intake forms. All set now!
Patients Preferred Time Zones:
To keep things simple and avoid appointment confusion, we’ve removed
EST
,
GMT
, and
CET
from the patient time zone menu, as these weren’t updating for Daylight Savings Time and were causing some timing hiccups.
We’ve made it easier for patients to find time zones—the list is now sorted alphabetically by city 🌍

New Auto Logout Feature
We’ve added a new layer of security to help keep sensitive information safe when have Jane open on multiple different tabs in your browser.🛡️ This update is especially helpful for those of you that share devices.
Imagine that you’re hard at work, multitasking like the best of them, with 10 tabs open. When you finish and log out of one tab but forget to close the rest, those leftover tabs will automatically redirect to the login screen if someone tries to click on them. This ensures your patient information stays secure and out of the wrong hands.
Because protecting your data isn’t just important—it’s personal and we take privacy, security, and HIPAA compliance very seriously around here. 💙
Automated Balance Reminders (Insurance)
Collecting leftover patient balances after insurance payments just got easier! With
Automated Balance Reminders
, Jane automatically sends payment requests to patients once their insurance claims are approved and there’s a remaining balance. Less hassle, more time saved, and better payment follow-ups!
Here’s what you need to know:
Jane detects when insurance claims are approved and there’s still a patient balance.
Notifications are sent by email, text, or both the morning after claims are settled.
Patients can pay directly through the link in the notification.
Improvements:
Timesheets:
Now you can
print
the Timesheets report! This makes it super simple for clinic owners to stay on top of payroll records and share them with payroll admins or third-party accountants. 🖨️
Changing a Patient to a Contact:
We know it can be confusing when someone in your system isn’t actually a patient. To make things smoother, you can now convert a patient profile into a contact! This means they’ll
no longer appear in your patient list
but will still be saved as part of your records.
Communications Log:
The Messages tab in patient and staff profiles has been renamed to
Communications
. Renaming this section of profiles will better represent what the communications log is for — a chronological log of all emails and SMS sent from Jane.
Patient’s Preferred Time Zones:
Appointment reminders just got a little smarter! Patients will now see their selected time zone in SMS reminders for multiple appointments, making scheduling clear and straightforward.
Improved Online Appointments:
We’ve boosted the quality of telehealth calls to
ensure consistent performance
, no matter your device or internet connection. Plus, you can now
customize your background
! Upload your own, pick from a selection of default options, or use a blur effect to keep the spotlight on participants. 🎥
Quick Quantities
: Save time with Jane’s new Quick Quantity feature! You can now type exact numbers directly into the Quantity section for treatments and products, skipping the endless clicks on those plus/minus buttons. Perfect for high-quantity items like Botox!
Group Appointments in the Jane Mobile App:
🇨🇦 Your clients can now manage
Group Appointments
directly from the Jane Mobile App. Here’s what that means for your clients:
Easily book a group appointment
Add multiple participants
Choose the primary payer
Need to adjust? Reschedule or cancel for just the primary or the whole group as needed!
Intake Forms & Surveys:
We’ve made some thoughtful updates to the
Intake Forms and Surveys Settings and Edit
pages to enhance usability and create a consistent experience for managing archived forms. Here’s what’s new:
The
Duplicate
and
Archive
buttons now live inside an easy-to-use action ellipses menu for a cleaner layout.
A new
filter
at the top of the intake forms page lets you toggle between archived and active forms.
You can now duplicate or archive an intake form directly from its
edit page
via the same action ellipses menu.
Fixes
Intake Forms & Surveys:
We fixed an issue where surveys stayed active past their end date.
Resending an intake form will no longer create duplicate forms in patient profiles.
There were instances where intake form eligibility was causing forms to keep resending, even after completion. That’s been taken care of!
Clinic Finances:
Printing reports using Safari no longer results in a blank page.
We’ve resolved an issue where receipts would show the total payment amount instead of the amount applied to the invoice, which could make it seem like an overpayment occurred. Your receipts should now reflect accurate payment details.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: February 19, 2025
Patient Preferred Time Zone Setting🌐
One size doesn’t always fit all, and we get it. That’s why we’ve added a brand-new setting that lets you enable or disable the
Patient Preferred Time Zone
feature.
Not serving patients or clients in other time zones? We’ve got you. If you don’t need your local time zone displayed on your online booking site—or if your current setup is already working perfectly—you can turn off the Patient’s Preferred Time Zone feature.
Just head to
Settings > Online Booking > Display Preferences
to make the switch.
Optional Secondary Insurance Details on Intake Form
Last year, we made it possible for patients to add multiple insurance policies to intake forms. Super helpful, right? But some clinics said, “Hey, we usually only handle primary claims, and this might confuse patients.”
Thanks to your feedback, we’ve introduced a new update. Now, you can choose whether to gather secondary insurance details on intake forms. Want to keep it simple with just the primary? No problem. Need more? You’re good to go.
Improvements
Intake Forms:
Updated the intake form so the ‘First Name,’ ‘Last Name,’ and ‘Email’ fields are now disabled when filling it out on behalf of another staff member. No more mix-ups!
Fixes
Intake Forms:
We addressed an issue where the intake form pass-to-patient flow wasn’t consistently blurring the background out as expected.
Pacific Blue Cross Integration
🇨🇦
: We’ve tweaked the copy appointment behaviour for PBC claims with multiple claim items to ensure that only the primary claim carries over to future appointments—keeping everything nice and tidy!
Supervision
We sorted out an issue where the “Load More” button wasn’t refreshing properly in the Supervision tab, sometimes making it appear like there were no charts to review.  A little misleading, but all cleared up now! 🚀
We addressed an issue that was causing charts that hadn’t been signed by a supervisor yet to display the locked icon 🔒 on the Day View.
Fixed an issue causing imported chart entries to show incorrectly as “pending review” status, when they should have displayed as “Signed”.
Charting
We fixed an issue that occurred when updating the Medical Alert field. It was making the patient profile pictures and names look off. Everything’s lined up perfectly now!
Scheduling
We fixed an issue where changes to the treatment length of a booked appointment weren’t saving as they should. 💾
We patched up an issue that temporarily caused rescheduled appointments to not trigger waitlist notifications as they should.
We also made sure shorter appointments (like a 10-minute booking within a 15-minute grid space) no longer filled the entire 15-minute grid space.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: January 24, 2025
Timesheets (Beta) Updates
Staff members can now
clock in
at the start of the day and
clock out
when they’re finished, right from the user menu in Jane (top right corner). Once clocked in, an ‘Open’ Timesheet will automatically begin and will close when you clock out. If clocking out slips your mind (we’ve all been there), this can easily be fixed by heading to your
Staff profile > Timesheets.
If your staff work split shifts or take multiple breaks, they can clock in and out as needed throughout the day.
We’ve also given the Timesheets report a little upgrade. Now you can see a detailed breakdown of individual timesheets for all staff members, making it easier for you to run payroll. Bonus? The Timesheets report is now accessible to everyone.
✅
Practitioner and Front Desk staff
can view their own Timesheets report.
✅
Admin and Full Access users
get visibility of everyones Timesheets report.
You can read more about Timesheets here >
Supervision updates
We made a few notable updates to
Supervision
in December. 🎉  While we’re still fine-tuning and adding new updates in the first part of 2025, we’re already seeing the meaningful impact these workflows bring to your practice.
What’s New?
Chart Activity Log
— Every supervisory signature from start to finish is now displayed to help keep a reliable audit trail of chart actions and to simplify billing and compliance.
Updated Reporting
— The
Appointments Report
now reflects all of the new chart states, like Pending Review and Changes Requested, so you have a clear view of the status of all your chart notes. Plus, your Practitioner Dashboards now come with clickable links to charts needing attention, making it so much easier to take action from your Day Sheet.
What’s Next?
Optional Signatures
— Soon, clinics will have the flexibility to decide if certain trainees require sign-off on
all
chart notes or not.
Multiple Supervisors
— Supervision often involves teamwork. We’re introducing the ability for trainees to have multiple supervisors at once.
Read more about Supervision workflows here >
Intake form names included in client emails.
We’ve made it easier for you and your clients to understand which forms they need to complete. When clients receive an email from Jane with a call-to-action to fill out forms,
the specific forms will now be clearly listed in the body of the email.
Improvements:
Insurance policies just got smarter!  We’ve rolled out a nifty update that flags when a policy attached to a visit is closed (a.k.a. no longer active).
Intake Forms:
We’ve relocated the “News & Special Promotions” setting to the
Consents
tab of the Intake Form builder, so you can manage all consent-related settings in one convenient place.
Voice to Chart:
We’ve rolled out an update to make managing session recordings and data even easier! Based on user feedback, we noticed most of you use Voice-to-Chart for less than 60 minutes at a time. To keep things smooth and efficient, we’ve set a cap at 90 minutes per session.
Here’s how it works:
At the 80-minute mark, you’ll get a friendly heads-up. ⏰
Hit 90 minutes? The recording will wrap up automatically.
Don’t worry—you can still start as many sessions as you’d like! Unlimited recordings, just a bit more structure. 😊
Fixes
Intake forms:
When a relative filled out a client’s intake form, Jane would sometimes get mixed up and accidentally give credit to the wrong “author” in the print preview. But don’t worry—Jane’s not playing author roulette anymore!
If a clients email was connected to multiple profiles, they were occasionally being locked out of their in-progress intake forms. We identified and fixed that bug!
We heard the Intake form was doing its best impression of a hamster wheel—stuck in an infinite loading loop when administrative staff clicked it. Don’t worry, we’ve caught that little bug and sent it packing! 🧳
Ratings and Reviews:
Turns out, Ratings and Reviews were trying to score double the attention by showing up twice in your staff dashboard. We gave them a friendly nudge and told them, “Nice try, but once is enough!” 🥸
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: December 10, 2024
Supervision with Feedback Loops!
We’ve added
Feedback Loops to your Supervision workflows
, helping bring even more of your supervision tasks right into Jane, directly inside chart entries. Everything stays in one place—organized, secure, and easy to manage.
Here’s how Feedback Loops can help:
Supervisors can leave feedback (or a little encouragement!) in a new note field at the bottom of a chart entry that’s Pending Review.
Supervisees can check all their charts and feedback in one spot, make updates, and send them back for review and signature.
Keep track of all requested changes to make chart completion smoother than ever.
Read more about how it works here >
It’s live in your account now! Head to
Settings → Supervision
to get started if you haven’t yet. And as always, we’d love to hear what you think! Drop us your
feedback here
. 🌟
Improvements to the Insurance Policy Report
We heard that this report wasn’t as helpful as it could be, so we’ve made a few updates that will help provide better info & easier action.
First & most highly requested, you can now filter for policies that are “
Awaiting Review
” to find any policies submitted by your clients via an intake form. We also added a “
Next Appointment
” column so you can choose to only see the policies of patients with upcoming appointments.
Once you’ve found the policies you’d like to check, you can now
click on the policy directly
from the report (woohoo!) so that you can take any action needed, like checking for missing details, running an eligibility check, or seeing the claims associated with that policy.
You can read more about the report here >
Treatment Add-Ons is now in Open Beta
You might have noticed something new in your account lately –
Treatment Add-Ons
can now be booked
administratively
in all Jane accounts!
Here’s what this first version of Treatment Add-Ons does for your clinic:
Your staff can now easily add services to appointments on behalf of your patients.
Set up, book, and bill for treatments and add-ons all at once.

Improvements
Client Relationships
: When a client creates a new profile for someone else (like a family member), that person will now get a friendly heads-up email. It’ll include info about permissions and your clinic’s contact info to make it easier for someone to reach out if they have any questions.
Intake Forms
: When Jane sent your client an Intake Form automatically, it was previously set to expire at the start of the appointment. To cover those cases where they just didn’t get around to filling it in, they now have up until an hour after their scheduled appointment to complete it.
Clinical Surveys
: We learned that some clients were submitting multiple responses to their surveys, so we’ve adjusted this so they can only submit once.
Fixes
Appointment Notifications
: We noticed that the appointment date was being hidden on change notification emails, so we cancelled that game of hide and seek.
Timesheets (Beta)
: We found that Jane wasn’t always returning the ‘freshest’ version of the Timesheets report to you as you tabbed through different reports, so we’ve given it a ‘refresh’.
🇺🇸 Insurance:
We fixed an issue that caused late cancellation invoices to be submittable if the late cancellation adjustment was removed.
Exporting the Insurance Policies report with more than 100 entries? No problem, we’ve fixed up a little hiccup that made this harder than it should be.

Timesheets is in Open Beta
🎉
Introducing
Timesheets
, a new feature designed to make life easier for administrators and clinic owners in Jane. Now, you can log admin working hours and run reports for payable hours—all in one place. Timesheets is designed with admin workflows in mind, so it’s not linked to practitioner schedules or patient appointments. Think of it as a way to track payable hours for admin tasks that aren’t tied to client care.
Here’s what Timesheets can do so far:
🕒 Log admin time worked for current or past dates.
✏️ Add break times and daily notes.
📊 Run Timesheets reports to easily pull payable hours.
Feedback Wanted
We’re just getting started and would love your input on how to make Timesheets even better. Don’t hold back—your feedback helps us improve!

(More) Insurance Info on Intake Forms
Patients can now add up to
3 insurance policies
on their Intake Forms. That means you’ll have their primary and secondary details ready to bill before their first appointment—saving you time (and headaches).
We’ve also tweaked how uploaded insurance card images are managed. Instead of cluttering up the patient’s Files section, the images will now go straight to their Insurance Policy where they’re easier to find at a glance.
👉 And about that change to insurance cards… we heard your feedback on visibility (thank you!) and made updates to ensure the cards are now easier to view with fewer clicks.
We hope these improvements minimize billing time and make getting paid a little smoother.
Improvements
Test Patient:
We’ve added a reset button to the Test Patient feature. Now you can clear out and start fresh whenever you need a clean slate. 🧹
Integrated Outbound Fax:
We’ve made it easier to know exactly what went wrong when a fax can’t be sent. Better error messages = less guesswork. 📠
Insurance Policy Report:
You can now open an insurance policy directly from the Insurance Policy Report with just one click. No extra steps—because who’s got time for that?
Fixes
Intake Forms:
Abracadabra—your action menu for manually sent intake forms has reappeared! No wand required; it’s back and ready for action. We’ve also enhanced the mobile signature component for a sharper look on the go. ✨

Supervision is in open beta
We’ve created Supervisory Relationships in Jane, making it easier for Supervisors to find and sign Supervisees’ chart notes.
Here’s what we have for you so far:
⭐ New roles and permissions for Supervisor and Supervisee
🫂 A Supervisor can oversee multiple Supervisees
🏷️ Supervisors will find a new tab in their Staff profile, making it easy to spot all charts needing their review
🔏 Supervisors will be able to sign off on charts without the need to change chart authorship 📝
🔙 If changes are required, Supervisors
can send the chart back
to a Supervisee in a draft state
What we’re building next:
🔁 We are building a
feedback loop
so you can provide feedback to your Supervisee in Jane — stay tuned for this update!
If you’re interested in giving the beta version of this feature a try, head to
Settings
and look for the snazzy new
BETA
badge beside the new Supervision option.
Improvements
Integrated Outbound Fax
: We’ve added an autocomplete feature so that any contact you’ve successfully faxed will auto-populate the name and fax number once you start typing. We hope this saves you all some time while we work on a bigger fax contact solution.
Approving Insurance Policies
: We’ve improved the workflow for reviewing insurance policies that your clients have submitted via their Intake Forms. Insurance card photos will now live in the Insurance Policy instead of Files. So, when you click Review Policy, you’ll be brought to the View screen of the Insurance Policy to review all the details— including the photo upload— before clicking Edit > Save & Approve. Once you’ve approved it, you’ll remain on the screen so you can finish up any other pieces of your workflow, like running an eligibility check.
Physitrack
: We’ve changed the name that gets sent to Physitrack to the client’s preferred name, if you’ve included one, rather than their legal name. If they don’t have a preferred name in Jane, it will default to their legal name.
My Account
-
Intake Form page
: We’ve made a couple of updates to be a little more accurate about when an Intake Form was updated and by who.
Insurer Invoices
: If you went to Billing > Insurer Invoices and clicked into any of your insurers in the past little while, you may have noticed that Jane was only loading Purchases from the past 30 days. This was to try to make sure Jane was able to pull up the info you needed as quickly as possible. We heard from many of you that you needed this time frame extended a little, though, so Jane will now pull up the past 180 days.
Fixes
Intake Forms
: Briefly, incomplete Intake Forms were showing that the author— which would usually be the patient— was “unknown”. What Jane meant to say was that the form technically didn’t have an author yet, since it hadn’t been completed. We’ve fixed that up so it’s a little bit more helpful now.

fax documentation directly from your patients’ charts
. Anyone with chart access will be able to securely send single entries, multiple entries within a date range, or all entries associated with a Treatment Plan— all without any downloading, uploading, or tab switching.
We’re so happy to have
Documo as a partner
because we know they’ll be a great fax solution for all the
not-yet-integrated things

Billing new UK accounts in GBP £
This one is for our chums across the pond! 🇬🇧 Until recently, we only had the ability to charge customers in CAD and USD. Now, we’re happy to say we can bill new UK sign-ups in Pounds Sterling (GBP). This means new customers’ monthly bills will always be the same and not subject to exchange rates.
For our current UK customers, you’ll continue to be billed in CAD while we work on a plan to smoothly transition you to GBP. We appreciate you being here despite the somewhat funky monthly billing. 💙
Improvements:
Chart Accessibility Updates
: We heard from a few customers that Jane’s charts were challenging to navigate via screen reader, so we’ve been making updates to improve that experience. Most recently, those have included improving the way Jane presents Side-by-Side Photos and an Options list in the chart.
ICD-10 Codes
: Jane’s ICD-10 Code Set has been refreshed, in keeping with the updates that came into effect October 1st. We’ve added 252 new codes, removed 36 outdated codes, and revised 13 codes.
Fixes
Pass to Patient
: For a minute there, if you clicked Pass to Patient on mobile, Jane wasn’t showing you the button to close the window after submitting an Intake Form. We’ve fixed this up for all of you mobile-first folks should be able to Pass to Patient without pause.

🇺🇸 Insurance Updates
They say— who exactly ‘they’ is, we’re not sure but they sound smart 😉— that good things come in threes, and our Insurance team recently rolled out three helpful updates for our 🇺🇸 insurance billing clinics. Let’s dive in!
1️⃣
Eligibility Check Design:
For those who check eligibility often, we’ve tidied up patients’ insurance policies. We’ve moved the Notes section above the Eligibility History to reduce scrolling. We now display just the last 3 checks by default, with a ‘Show More’ option for extra details.
2️⃣
Recording Manual Payments:
If you manually log insurer payments, we’ve revamped the design to make it clearer when recording your EOBs. The ‘Edit’ button is now “Record EOB,” and we’ve removed the blue color from the ‘Apply’ button to avoid unintended clicks.
3️⃣
Insurance Policies:
To simplify reviewing patient insurance policies labeled “Awaiting Review,” there’s a new filter option. You can find it under Patient Profile > Billing > Insurance Policies and Billing > Insurer Invoices > Insurance Policies.
In future, we plan to bring this filter to the Insurance Policies Report as well, so stay tuned for an update on that!
Resources Improvements
We’ve been working on leveling up Resources, a key player in our advanced scheduling team, as we noticed they weren’t giving it their all. After a pep talk from the coach, we’re seeing Resources getting along better with Group Appointments and Classes. Now, you’ll see that you can:
Choose a resource for classes and group appointments when booking an appointment by simply clicking the schedule, just like with regular appointments.
Edit/Remove a resource from the Appointment Panel.
We hope these small tweaks will make managing Resources for your Group Appointments and Classes a breeze!
Fixes
Physitrack Integration
:
We found that having special characters in patient names was causing an error, but we’ve fixed that now. 🛠️
Charting:
We cracked the case of the missing
Copy to Patient
window that was playing hide and seek when a staff member signed a duplicated group chart entry. 🕵🏻‍♂️
The
Smart Options
chart part was being a bit lazy and forgot to capitalize the first letter of a paragraph when converting to print or PDF view. That’s been taken care of now.
When a chart was signed, Note fields were no longer readable by screen readers tools. We’ve fixed that!
Intake Forms
:
We found out that when copying an intake form with markdown in the consent area, it was deleting the markdown in the new version. Some staff members also had trouble updating the consent area, but we’ve sorted that out now.
We fixed an issue where intake form questionnaires were left out of the intake form template builder. 🛠️
Inactive staff members’ names were showing up as options in the intake form builder for a short while. All sorted now! 🧹

Changelog: August 6th, 2024
Telehealth & Jane Payments
As a little bit of background, our
integrated payment
partner, Stripe, has telehealth listed as a “restricted” service (which is not the same as prohibited). This is pretty standard in the payments industry since telehealth is deemed as ‘higher risk’ for folks selling illegal products or services. And, while that might make sense in the payment processing world, we know it doesn’t for our customers, who are using telehealth to provide care for their communities.
So we’ve been working closely with Stripe to find a solution and
I’m happy to say that Jane users who offer telehealth will no longer have to fill out any additional documentation! 🎉
A quick note about
telemedicine
: Stripe’s terms of service (like most other payment solutions) prohibit the sale of prescription medications, including via a video call. So
if you prescribe and use telehealth
, you may still have your account paused while Stripe requests more information.
If you’re curious if this would apply to your business, please
reach out to our team
to chat. 💙
Improvements
Insurance Billing
: If you’re looking to attach a patient’s insurance from a previous visit to a new appointment, Jane previously only gave you options from the last 3 appointments. Now, you’ll be able to choose from one of the previous 5 appointments, just in case you need to go back a little further to find the right policy.
Setting up Packages
: We noticed that Jane made it a little too easy to accidentally create a package that included only a single treatment. So, we’ve had a little chat with Jane about what ‘package’ means and that shouldn’t happen moving forward.
🇨🇦
TELUS eClaims
: Someone once wrote that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but we think accuracy smells even sweeter, so we’ve changed ‘Equitable Life of Canada’ to ‘Equitable’ to match its rebrand.
🇨🇦
SMS Reminders & Notifications
: We are moving all of our Canadian SMS reminders and notifications over to a single Verified Toll-Free Number to ensure they won’t be flagged or filtered by carriers (
as a result of this new legislation
). If your clients ask why the number changed, this is why!

Changelog: July 19th, 2024
Receipts in the Patient Portal
Receipt-hunting no more! We’ve made it so patients can easily access and download their receipts through the
patient portal
.
This update is all about making it a breeze for your patients to find receipts for past payments, like you see in the receipts tab in their patient portal, especially come tax time. It saves time for both you and your staff as well, skipping the back-and-forth of phone calls and emails for resending receipts.
Update Go-Forward Cost of Sold Memberships
Updating sold membership amounts used to be a hassle, requiring a call to customer support for cost adjustments.
Now, with our latest update to Memberships, you can update the ongoing cost of sold memberships with just one click - much more efficient!
This change will automatically be reflected in the current billing cycle without affecting any previously invoiced amounts. To ensure transparency, any updates to sold memberships, passes, or packages will also be recorded in the activity log.
2-Step Verification
Account owners can now enforce 2-step verification (2SV) for all practitioners and admins in their Jane account. It’s an all-or-nothing switch, so either everyone will be required to use 2SV or no one will. If you’re not ready to enforce 2SV for everyone yet, practitioners can still choose to enable it individually.
Account owners can also choose a grace period. During this time, practitioners will get a gentle nudge to set up 2SV and they won’t get locked out of their accounts. Once the grace period ends, they’ll need to set up 2SV before accessing their accounts.
Stay secure out there. 🔒
Improvements
Intake Form Consents:
Our Intake Form consents now come with some new formatting options! ✨ These upgrades are designed to help you highlight crucial information, making it simpler for patients to read and understand. You can now:
Bold
,
italicize
, or underline text
Include links to external sources for additional information
Create bullet points or numbered lists
Select from 3 acknowledgment types that best fit your needs
We hope these enhancements will make formatting your consents easier than ever!
Insurer Statements:
We’ve spruced up the design to prevent timeouts when generating Insurer Statements. Previously, hitting ‘Statement’ in
Billing > Insurer Invoices
tried to whip up a statement for all past purchases, which could be a lot if you’ve been with Jane a while. Now, by default, you’ll see your last 30 days of purchases, and default filters pop up right on the page for easy access and clarity.
Email Reminders
: We’ve spruced up our email templates and now, your patients can easily manage their credit cards through their email reminders.
Security Features:
We given
automatic sign out properties
a new home in the new Security page in Settings.
Treatments:
We created a default “Initial Consultation” treatment specifically for new aesthetics clinics to ease your setup and show how you might start to organize your treatments. This is a new experiment to improve activation rates of medical aesthetics clinics.
Fixes
Intake Forms
: We’ve sorted out a situation where archived insurers were sneaking past the bouncers into the intake form party. Your forms should be archived-insurer-free now.
Fullscript
: We fixed a pesky issue that caused Fullscript to throw an error when setting up a new patient.

Eligibility Checks with
Claim.MD
If you are in the U.S. 🇺🇸 you can now make
real-time eligibility checks in Jane
through
our Claim.MD integration
. 🎉
With this new feature, you can run an eligibility check in just a couple of clicks directly within your patient’s insurance policy. Within seconds, you’ll see the results of the check, which you can easily filter to find what you need and refer back to in the future.
If you’re ready to get started, you can grab your API key from your Claim.MD Account Settings, and head to
Settings > Integrations > Clearinghouse
in Jane. If you haven’t gotten started with Claim.MD yet, we have a few
helpful resources here
.
We hope this helps you collect patient responsibility, reduce rejections, and improve your overall cash flow.
Counsellors added to TELUS eClaims 🇨🇦
If you’re a counsellor in Canada, you can likely now
direct bill through Jane’s TELUS eClaims integration!
🎉
TELUS has recently added more designations to its platform — meaning that counsellors who are members of eligible colleges and associations can now sign up and use the eClaims integration to offer direct billing for their clients.
Direct billing through eClaims lets you leave your sessions on a healing note, rather than a transactional one — so ensure you’re set up with
Jane’s insurance features
if you’re not already!

Improvements
Insurance Policy Visit Tracking Improvement
We’ve given our insurance policy tracker an updated lesson in counting!  Before, our system counted no-shows, late cancellations, and product sales in with your treatments, making the visit count a bit unreliable. Now, only completed appointments (yep, the ones your clients actually show up for) will count towards their treatment tally. This means the numbers will match up more closely with your insurance guidelines. Win-win!
Fixes
Test Patient:
Our new test patient,
Ted Test
, was attempting to play hide-and-seek in the patient list, so we made it so his Test Patient badge was showing up consistently. Now, you’ll always know where he is.
Integrations:
Physitrack had a little hiccup creating duplicate chart drafts while assigning a program - we encouraged Physitrack to drink some water, and that hiccup is all gone now.
Intake Forms:
Some Intake form questionnaire submissions were being displayed in the incorrect order. We’ve fixed that up so now those submissions will display as they should.
🇨🇦
Insurance
: We were hearing some reports of an issue that was preventing the claim submission status from updating at the top of the appointment panel for TELUS eClaims and Pacific Blue Cross PROVIDERnet integrated claim submissions, this has been resolved.
🇺🇸
Insurance
: We also took care of an issue where the US insurance Remittance folder count wasn’t updating after a remittance was fully reviewed.

Changelog: May 29th, 2024
SMS Appointment Reminder Changes for New Clients
Previously, SMS appointment reminders could be enabled for clients by default in Jane. However, as of May 21, new clients must consent to receive SMS reminders to keep your clinic communications in line with changing telecommunication regulations. They can choose this in their preferences when booking in for the first time, in their “My Account” space,  or be opted-in administratively by you. (Tip: include this step in your new client checklist.✅) Canadian clinics may also notice SMS reminders coming from a new toll-free number.
Conveniently, there will be no changes to SMS appointment reminders for existing clients or to email reminders.
Accessibility Improvements
We have been working hard in many areas in Jane to be more accessible to all our users and have been tackling some updates that will improve the experience for folks who have limited vision and rely on assistance from tools such as screen readers.
We’ve learned that long drop-down menus can be problematic, as screen readers read out each item within the drop-down, making it inefficient to navigate things like forms and settings. So, we’ve made a couple of behind-the-scenes improvements by turning those into “text” fields:
Intake Forms:
The
pronoun fields
in intake form submissions no longer offer dropdown suggestions, instead, they now feature a free text input.
Clinical Survey Settings:
Similarly, we’ve also removed the (very long) dropdown menu within the question, “How many occurrences?”, which can now be freely typed into the field
“For how many appointments?”
.
Improvements
Charting
:
We’ve added a new step asking you to confirm before resetting a chart part so that you don’t end up accidentally removing or losing any of the work you have done. Nobody likes to work twice as hard for nothing!
Intake Forms
:
Some of you noticed that trying to add insurance collection to your intake forms before you had set up your insurers was causing a problem. We’ve added a reminder to the Intake Form setup process that will prompt you to create Insurers before entering insurance info.
Fixes
Intake Forms:
We’ve fixed an issue with some of the
required fields
that was stopping folks from moving on from the profile section. Should be smooth sailing again from here. ⛵
We had a few reports from a handful of you letting us know that sometimes forms were skipping the questionnaire and insurance steps - and that just won’t do - that’s been all fixed up now.
Charting:
We learned of an issue that was preventing touch-enabled Windows users from drawing on Sketch and Spine parts. That’s been taken care of so you go back to your works of art.
Integrations:
We fixed an issue where linking a suggested patient in the
Physitrack Integration
didn’t refresh the page, instead, it showed a success message but then returned to the “create/link” page. That’s been all tidied up now.

Changelog: May 8th, 2024
🇺🇸 New Filter in Claim Submissions Folder
For our US customers, you’ll now be able to run a better pre-flight check to look for claims without signed chart notes before billing it! We’ve added a new filter to the claim submission folders to make it really easy to identify claims with and without signed notes.
Treatment Plans
Staff members without Access Billing permissions can now access Treatment Plans!  Now when you head into a patient chart, you’ll see the
New Treatment Plan
button. 🥳
To learn more about how to use Treatment Plans, check out our guide with a new tutorial video to watch along with.
Improvements
Wait List Notifications
:
We heard that patients sometimes found the wait list emails confusing, leading to frustration when they assumed appointments were auto-booked, when in fact they needed to take action. We don’t blame them! So, we made a few tweaks to the email to hopefully clear up that confusion.
Calendar Subscription Update
:
We’ve added a new setting that lets you choose to exclude appointment notes (not charts) from syncing over to your calendar outside of Jane. Plus, decide how you want your patients’ names displayed - full names or just initials!
Intake Forms
:
We’ve added a helpful ’Return to Forms & Surveys’ navigation button to the Intake Form & Survey builder page for those times when you just need to take a step back.
Translation:
We’ve added a new currency translation for our clinics in Vietnam 🇻🇳
Fixes
Charting:
We made some tweaks to the chart entries for better accessibility and ended up with a distracting focus outline on chart parts. We fixed it up now, so no more distractions!
We know that not every chart part necessarily needs a label. We recently made a tweak that caused an unwanted default label to pop up, but no worries - we’ve sorted that out!
We’ve tackled a few rogue issues that were cutting short the temperature details and leaving stray punctuation in the spine chart part notes when pinned to the top of a chart.

Insurance
:
We spotted that the
Copy Previous
options on the Appointment Panel were popping up unnecessarily at times, such as when there was no billing info to copy from a past appointment. Goodbye to those unnecessary actions! 👋🏻
We found a tiny hiccup that was requiring patients to add their middle name when sharing insurance info on the intake form. That’s been fixed and is totally optional now! 😊
Charting
:
We’ve sorted out two issues with uploaded files in a patient’s profile. One was making files sometimes not update automatically in the chart when edited in the
Files
tab. The other was making Files show up in its own chart entry even if “Include in patient’s chart” wasn’t selected at upload. Case (or should we say File) closed! 🕵🏻‍♂️
In some instances, the Medical Alert was not showing up on a patient’s chart so our team has sorted that out too. All those important details are back where they belong – front and centre. 🥇

Treatment Plans Report
Introducing the latest enhancement to Treatment Plans — an insightful report! 📊 Now, you may see all of your patient plans in one place, giving you a greater view of your caseload. The report helps to identify which patients are active with open treatment plans so you can stay proactive in ensuring patients adhere to their plans.
To check it out, head to
Reports
and look for the new
Care
category. You’ll see the report broken down by
Plan Status, Visits, Diagnosis
and key
Appointment
dates.
You’ll also be able to filter the report by
Diagnosis,
Plan Status
and
Staff Member
(who created the plan).
Note
: If you don’t see Treatment Plans in your account, you are likely on Jane’s Base Plan subscription. This feature is supported by built-in diagnosis codes that are currently accessible from the Insurance Plan.
New Email Preference Display
We recognized that when looking at a patient profile, it wasn’t always clear if a patient is meant to receive emails from your clinic or not. We wanted to help demystify this so we’ve reorganized this section with some new headings and icons.
Now, you can see which emails your patients are opted in for under clear headings in their profile:
🔔 Email Notifications - for appointment confirmations and reminders
📢 Marketing Emails
⚙️ All Email Settings -  a master switch that allows you to choose whether your patients should be emailed anything or not. Under this header, you may see ‘Do Not Email’ or ‘Emails Allowed’, depending on what you have chosen for your patient.
If you’ve chosen ‘Do Not Email’ for any patients, Jane will now show a new ⚠️ icon next to other email categories indicating that those emails won’t be sent to your patients.
Heads Up: SMS Updates for Reminders and Notifications
Texting
all Jane clinics!  To keep you on top of clinic-to-patient communication regulations, we have some updates to SMS reminders and notifications coming down the pipeline in mid-March.
You won’t experience disruptions to any SMS notifications previously set up, but there are some subtle patient communication changes that we want to give you a heads-up about.
Shortly you’ll see:
SMS appointment reminders will be coming from a new (toll-free) number for our Canadian clinics and their patients 🇨🇦
Patients will be asked to opt in to receive SMS reminders during their setup when they join a new clinic. (This is a simple, one-click action that fits naturally into their setup.)
The SMS “subscribe by default” behaviour will change to ensure patients choose to receive these SMS reminders first.
Reach out to us if you have any questions about staying compliant with SMS regulations

: In some rare instances, Jane would send out duplicate reminder emails for upcoming telehealth appointments. Nobody needs extra emails in their life, so we’ve fixed that up. 📤
🇬🇧
Internationalization
: Sharing insurance policy information via the intake form should feel a little more familiar for patients in the UK now that we have renamed the field for an
Authorisation Code
.
Charting
:
The
Spine chart part
received a little spinal decompression therapy recently as it was extending off the screen at times. That’s now resolved. ✔️
We’ve also taken care of an issue that caused the disappearance of the header, staff member’s name, and sub-navigation on the staff
Phrases
page when refreshing the browser.
The ‘most popular’ search filter in the
Template Library
is back in action after a brief intermission. 🎬

Changelog: February 26th, 2024
New Copy Previous Button
We’ve updated the way you can copy previous insurance information to a scheduled appointment with a new Copy Previous button! Now, you’ll see the new button right on the appointment panel, rather than having to look for it within the ‘Add Policy’ dropdown where it was previously located.
We hope that this small change (and one less click) will make it just that little bit easier to add these details to an appointment.
Fixes
Chart Templates:
We fixed an issue that was happening if you shared a chart template to the Template Library with custom images in it. At times, these images weren’t uploaded properly causing them to be unavailable when clinics downloaded the template.
Schedule:
Jane had a minor case of the hiccups — specifically some niche Scheduling hiccups— that luckily only impacted a few people. But, a few is a few too many, so we held our breath and yelled, “boo” at each other (aka our developers worked very hard) until the hiccups stopped. 👻
Translations:
We fixed up some awkward english phrasing in Welcome Emails for our German clinics. 🇩🇪
We’ve adjusted the Appointment Reminder phrasing in French to be more clear. 🇫🇷
Lastly, we noticed that the way we were translating the ‘Other Referral’ option in Danish wasn’t quite right, so that’s been tidied up. 🇩🇰

Multiple Diagnosis Codes in Treatment Plans
We’re pleased to bring you the first update to Treatment Plans since its release in late November! We heard loud and clear that you’d like to have more than just a single primary diagnosis code recorded in a patient’s plan, so now you can add up to three. 🎉
Once added, you can drag and drop your codes into whichever order you’d like.
We hope this helps you to track your patients’ secondary and tertiary diagnoses, and gives you greater visibility of them at a glance in their charts.
Improvements
Online Appointments (Telehealth)
: There’s been a behind-the-scenes update that we’re hoping makes some improvements in the quality of your calls. We expect call quality and stability improvements to continue with this update—and have many more to come.
We’d love to hear if you’ve noticed better call quality since this update on January 29th. Let us know by
rating your call
at the end of every online appointment. 💙
🇬🇧
Healthcode Batch Upload Tool (beta)
: For our clinics in the United Kingdom, we have made two recent updates to make submissions easier.
For AXA submissions, you won’t be required to enter the injury date to get through pre-submission validation any longer.
For BUPA, claims can now be submitted using professional numbers of any length. 🔢
Jane Payments
: Our clinics in Thailand are now able to sign up with Jane Payments to start getting paid more easily. 🇹🇭
Fixes
Schedule
: This week, a Chrome update caused some surprising blank spaces to appear on some of your schedules. We quickly found a way to fix that and bring colour (aka joy and cheer) back. 🌈
New Patient Sign-Up
: We learned recently of an issue that was preventing new patients from sharing how they heard about your clinic when selecting “Other” during the sign-up flow. This has been fixed and you’ll be seeing those lovely details again.
🇺🇸 Insurance
: We noticed an error that was preventing
past insurer payments
from appearing automatically in the Insurer Invoices folder unless you pressed ‘load more’ repeatedly. Let’s get back to working smarter, not harder shall we? 💪🏻
Charting
:
We’ve fixed up an issue that caused the
vitals and optical chart parts
to not display text content when pinned 📌 in a patient’s chart.
We also took care of an issue affecting Full Access users when exporting their list of
Phrases
. Instead of receiving a list of all Phrases from the clinic, they’ll just get their own now as intended.

Jane Guide Sidekick (beta)
We are always aiming to help our helpers, and part of that is making sure that you have resources available at your fingertips. The next time you pop into the
Need Help?
menu in your Jane account, you will be greeted by your new Jane Guide Sidekick 👋🏻 — an AI-powered assistant that helps you get the answers you need when you need them.
You have the option to “search” and your Sidekick will pull up relevant guides for you. You may also “ask a question,” and the AI assistant will guide you to a chatbot that reads Jane’s guides and gives you a brief answer with a cited source.
We hope that you find this to be a helpful complement to Jane’s support options, especially for those times when you need a quick gut check or answer to a Jane question.
Improvements
2-Step Verification
:
As you know, If you have 2-Step Verification (2SV) enabled, Jane gives you the option to “remember this device for 30 days” when signing in as an extra layer of security, but for those clinics that have multiple users signing in on a shared device, you were being asked to verify yourselves for each sign in. Now, we store 2SV preferences on both the user
and
device level so you won’t be retrieving 6-digit codes to infinity. ♾️
Deactivating Staff Members
:
We heard you loud and clear that deactivating a staff member’s profile could be tedious and time-consuming when their schedule was loaded with personal breaks. So we did something about it and now, once you have rescheduled or removed any appointments, Jane will now ignore those breaks and give you some time back in your day. ✨
🇺🇸 Claim Submissions
:
We’ve upgraded the Insurers filter in the claim submission folders so that you can select multiple insurers now instead of just one at a time. Happy multi-selecting! ☑️
Fixes
Charts
:
We learned that images that had been uploaded to a
Sketch
chart part wouldn’t show up in Print/PDF exports if they hadn’t been marked up in any way, so our team went to the drawing board to get that fixed. 🧑🏻‍🎨
While we were at it, we fixed an issue that prevented the
Spine
chart part title from appearing in printed charts.
Intake Forms
:
We tackled an issue that was causing the intake form questionnaire to create numerous individual entries in a patient chart instead of just one.
We also learned that intake form notification emails were not always being sent to profiles with a relationship that was set up to receive them. That’s been fixed!
You may have encountered a challenge on a mobile device or tablet when trying to add a template to your intake form questionnaire by using the ‘Add Item’ button. That’s been resolved.
We found an issue that was causing an intake form’s Appointment Type setting to reset when the form was being updated causing it to be sent out to appointment types it wasn’t intended for. This has been fixed!

Collecting Outstanding Balances
ICYMI, last month we added some new filtering and sorting options to the
Accounts Receivable Report
to help you collect outstanding balances.
With these additions, you can now:
Filter by Insurer or Patient Account
Sort by Name, Amount Owing, and Age of the outstanding balance by clicking on the column headings
From the Purchases tab of your Patient or Insurer Billing screen, you can also:
Filter for All Private Outstanding & All Claims Outstanding using the Status drop-down
Filter by Invoice Age
Best of all, when you click into an Account from the AR Report, Jane will automatically apply those filters so you only see the invoices contributing to the account’s outstanding balance. 🎉
Improvements
Translation:
For clinics in Switzerland 🇨🇭, we have added two new language locale options, providing you the option of using either German or French for your Jane account and all client-facing communication.
Settings Search:
Did you know that you can search for keywords in the settings area to more quickly find what you need? 🔍 We are continually adding to this and recently loaded more than 20 new keywords to make it easier to find insurance-related things.
Fixes
Schedule
: We came across an issue for staff with
practitioner-limited access
that was preventing you from being able to see or update reservations (bookings that are started, but not finalized) that you created. That has been fixed now so you will always have the ability to manage the reservations you create.
Outcome Measure Surveys:
We realized that surveys were showing more decimal places than needed so we have put those rogue decimals back in their place. 🧑🏻‍🏫

Changelog: January 3rd, 2024
Statements & Email With Pay Button
ICYMI, our Jane Payments users received a last-minute holiday gift at the end of December. 🎁
Now, when you are sending clients their statements, there is an option to include a secure link for clients to pay their outstanding balance online. We hope that this addition will increase the chances of you getting paid quickly.
Side-by-Side Photos Chart Part
Last month, we released a new chart part that allows you to upload two images beside one another in a patient’s chart to help you document your clients’ care visually. You are able to draw or notate on the images if you like, and more easily share comparison photos with your clients so they may see their progress for themselves.
Improvements
Translation:
We’ve made some updates to Jane’s fonts behind the scenes so we can now support extra accented characters that are common in the alphabet for some of our global users, like our friends in Slovakia. 🇸🇰
Fixes
🇺🇸 We fixed an issue with Jane’s permissions that was preventing Administrator / All Billing users in the US from accessing the new Merge Insurers tool.
Phrases
:
We noticed Jane wasn’t always honouring your formatting (like capitalizing letters or bolding words) so, moving forward when you create a Phrase with formatting, Jane will save those details so they appear every time you use that new phrase.
Surveys
:
We learned that if some folks completing a survey pressed Enter while providing details within a checkbox with notes field, the survey would submit as if complete. We can’t have that, so it’s been corrected.
Intake Forms
:
We fixed an issue that was preventing some of you who aren’t using Jane Payments from saving Intake Forms because Jane was asking for credit card settings to be set up. No more red error messages for you.❗
Reports:
We noticed that Jane was displaying the legal name of an insurer instead of the internal name on insurance reports when exported, so we took care of that.
We resolved an issue where the
Inventory
and
Product Performance
reports were displaying blank pages when printed.

🆕 Chart Search Filter
Searching for Chart Entries, Intake Forms, or Surveys in a patient chart just got easier with a new “Entry Types” search filter to help narrow your scope and find the entry you need much quicker.
To check this out, head to any patient chart, select
Filter / Export
and you’ll see the new
Entry Types
option to filter for what you are looking for.
Improvements
Online Booking:
For clinics with lots of practitioners and treatments, Jane was a little slow to show patients the available appointments when booking online, so we’ve done a little tinkering under the hood to bring your patients those options much quicker. 🏎️
Treatment Plans
:
If you’ve ever created a new chart entry under the wrong patient profile, we’ve made it possible to move that chart entry from within a Treatment Plan to another patient’s chart.
Insurance Policies Report:
We heard that it would be nice to filter this report by Staff Member, so now, you’ll see this helpful addition on the filter bar.
Jane Payments
:
For our friends in Greece, you’re now able to sign up with Jane Payments so you can start to get paid easier. Opa! 🇬🇷
Translation
: For our clinics in Morocco, you may now update your Language settings to the newly added
French - Morocco
option so you may choose to display all client-facing communication en français.
Chart Note Export
:
When you’re exporting a patient chart and need an updated copy, we’ve made it easier to see how to do that on the spot. We’ve replaced an inconspicuous black button with a pretty Jane blue “Load a fresh copy” link. We hope you like it!
Fixes
🇨🇦 Insurance:
We were told that the 👁️ icon in the Provider settings for the TELUS eClaims integration wasn’t revealing the password as intended, so that’s been fixed.
Charting:
We fixed up some confused special characters that were showing up in exported Chart PDFs. Now, when you have an &, >, or < in your notes, they’ll show up as they are supposed to.
Treatment Plans:
We noticed that archived draft chart entries were still being counted in Treatment Plans. We’ve taken care of that so those entries stay out of sight where they belong.
We’ve ensured that when you are exporting charts from a Treatment Plan, the plan details will be included so all the relevant information is available on those exported files.

Changelog: December 1st, 2023
Treatment Plans
Treatment Plans are now available on Jane’s Insurance Plan, making it easier to provide better care and track patient progress. Now, you can track the start and end date of treatment for a specific diagnosis, count the number of appointments attended, and have greater visibility into patient treatment across a clinic.
To try it out, head to a patient’s charting area and you will see a 🆕
New Treatment Plan
button. Once clicked, you may fill in the Treatment Plan Name, then add an Area of Focus, and a suggested number of visits.
We’re working to add more to this feature in the future and would love to
hear your feedback
as we continue to develop it.
Merge Insurers
We are excited to bring our 🇺🇸 clinic friends the ability to merge two duplicate insurers with just a couple of clicks. This was previously not possible without a call to the Jane team. For any folks outside of the US, if you would find this function helpful too, let our team know!
To check this out, head to
Settings > Insurers
and you’ll see a lovely 🆕
Merge Insurers
button.
Improvements:
Translations
:
For those with account locales set to French, we noticed that Jane wasn’t translating the patient number, date of birth, and email details for you when exporting a chart entry, so that’s been taken care of.
We’ve added a new currency translation for our clinics in Morocco 🇲🇦
Accessibility:
We are striving to improve the experience of navigating the Day View for folks using a screen reader tool. Now, you may press “Enter” on an appointment to open up the patient’s chart directly.
Fixes:
Intake Forms
:
We heard that Jane wasn’t allowing you to add new consents to Intake Forms when all previous consents had been deleted.  This has been fixed so you won’t be stuck in limbo any longer.
It appeared that Claim Numbers were occasionally not appearing on Intake Forms, but we’ve let the forms know that it’s time for the game of hide and seek to be over.
We also found an error that was occasionally causing Jane to send too many Intake Forms. Nobody wants extra work to do, so we quickly fixed that up.
Charting:
We were told that Jane had confused some words in the
Optical Measurement Table
. We corrected that so
cycle
is now
cylinder
and Jane is going to book in for an eye exam. 👓
We heard that
Classes
were disappearing from the schedule when all participants were removed by a staff member leaving an empty class. We have fixed this up so Classes will always be in attendance on your schedule — no more skipping! 🧑🏻‍🏫
We’ve also tightened up the
access for staff members
with Practitioner (Limited) permissions so that they cannot see Product sales for other practitioners’ patients.

Treatment Duplication
Whether you are in the process of setting up your Jane account for the first time, or are planning on adding new treatments at your clinic, you’ll now be able to create a new treatment, class, or group appointment by duplicating an existing offering in your account, saving you valuable time while still allowing you to offer as many customized treatments as you’d like without having to start from scratch.
To try this, Full Access users can head to
Settings
>
Treatments, Classes & Group Appointments
, and you’ll see a handy 🆕 Duplicate button next to the treatment you’d like to copy.
Clinic Sites Integration
For those of you that have created brilliant websites with our friends at Clinic Sites, it is now much easier to access your website admin page from right within Jane. Head to your
Settings
>
Integrations
and you’ll see 🆕 “Sign-In” button to easily access your website to make changes. Could it get any easier?
Yes, it can! Now if you are just getting started with Jane, the Onboarding Wizard will offer to help you get started with Clinic Sites - only if you want to, of course. Simply follow the prompts to
Start Your Site

Improvements:
Activity Log
:
For Account Owners who like to stay on top of changes being made in your accounts, we’ve added some more specifics regarding treatments so that you have more information. Now, you’ll be able to see additional details, like which specific treatment was updated or created.
🇺🇸
Insurance Billing:
We heard that the Remittance progress bar was a little confusing because it didn’t expand the length of the screen when all steps were complete. Quite frankly, we agree,  and now you’ll notice that helpful green line stretches fully across the page when you’ve finished reviewing your claims.
We’ve made a small change to the Claim Submissions folders. Modifiers are now displayed in the Procedures column in brackets to the right of each CPT code, so you can take a peek at what’s been added or missed before selecting the claims you’d like to bill.
Fixes:
Translation:
We noticed that the book-at-location phrasing for our French-speaking clinics was
pas très bon
so that’s been fixed.
Online Booking:
We noticed that Jane was adding an extra number on the online booking site when multiple openings were available within a set timeframe. Now the number shown will accurately reflect the right number of available appointments. No more unwanted +1s!
Schedule:
We heard that sometimes pressing the
tab
key after clicking on an appointment would cause a blank space to appear and block the screen. That’s been fixed up now so folks can tab away to their heart’s content and we can leave the Blank Space to Taylor Swift 🎶
Intake Forms
:
We have acted on some feedback from our mental health helpers, to ensure that when creating new intake forms, they will not be set up to send automatically by default. You’ll be able to make that change when you are ready to start sending those forms.
🇨🇦
Insurance (BC)
:
A few improvements for our BC customers billing MSP 🗣️  You know that frustrating feeling when you get a vague error message, and it disappears in the blink of an eye? Us too! Now, when you’re checking eligibility for MSP supplementary benefits, we’ll do our best to give you more info on those pesky errors. Plus, the error message won’t vanish into thin air anymore – it’ll stick around in the patient profile.

ICD-10 Code Set Update
It’s that time of year when we hunker down and do some organizing and purging to stay on top of CMS updates. We added 19 CPT codes to Jane’s library and tidied away several old codes that are no longer valid or needed.
Phrases Update
You can now create a new
Phrase
directly from a chart as you type it, rather than having to do it from your staff profile. We hope this helps you chart even faster than before 🎉
Improvements:
Patient Search:
If you’ve ever had trouble distinguishing between patients and clients with similar names, the search is over. When typing in the Patient Search Tab, Jane now shows you some additional helpful context -
the phone number and the birthdate
- so you can more easily find the profile you’re looking for.
Adjustments:
We’ve made a few tweaks to the Billing Info area on your appointment panel so you no longer have to hover over the section to reveal the Adjustment button. No more playing hide and seek when trying to apply a price change or discount.
Fixes:
🇺🇸
Insurance Billing
: Jane wasn’t picking up on occasional changes to the type of patient responsibility entered in EOBs (i.e. copay swapped for coinsurance). Whenever you edit an EOB going forward, you can rest easy knowing that the right type of patient responsibility will be displayed on patient invoices, receipts, and statements.
Translations:
For those of you with your clinic locale set to Japan 🇯🇵, we’ve corrected a small typo found on the Book By Discipline page.
For our clinics using any of our French locale settings, we’ve cleaned up the translation of “button” en français as it was previously shown in English.

🇺🇸 Billing Provider Update
Calling all U.S. insurance users. 📣 If you’re someone who works with Billing Provider information in Jane, this one’s for you! To simplify this process, we’ve made a few changes to the Staff Billing Settings and the Insurance Information section in Settings > Location.
Here’s what’s new:
💼 If you’re one of the many clinics that bill under one Billing Provider and Tax ID, you may likely find it tedious to update this information on every staff member’s profile. So to save you time, we’ve added an option allowing you to add a Tax ID and Billing Provider Taxonomy Code to your clinic location, instead of having to add this information to each individual staff member’s Billing Settings.
🚛 Since the Tax ID can be added to the location now, we’ve gone ahead and moved the Tax Id fields to the Custom Billing Provider section, and made these optional fields.
💡 We’ve also updated the labels and added some helpful tips to the fields listed under Settings > Locations > Insurance Information to make the process a bit more clear.
We hope this will provide a smoother and simplified experience when updating Billing Information in Jane, and hopefully prevent some unwanted billing errors! 💪
Learn more about setting up billing info >
Improvements:
🇺🇸
U.S. Insurance:
If you receive an ERA with more than 100 claim responses, Jane will now separate these into multiple pages to help avoid long lag times without disrupting your workflow.
Telehealth:
If you use Online Appointments for Groups, this one’s for you. We want your clients to have the best experience possible during online appointments, and we’ve heard time and time again that Chrome provides the most consistent experience when joining a call on desktop. So now when your clients get ready to join a call on a non-Chrome browser, we’ve sprinkled in some helpful reminders for them to use Chrome when possible, along with some other helpful tips!
Intake Forms:
To avoid unwanted client notifications, we’ve re-introduced an intake form time span for in-progress intake forms of 1 year or less. Only clients who haven’t completed their intake form within the last year will be prompted to complete them.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: September 11th, 2023
Update: Longer-term Memberships
The number of billing cycles you can set for your Memberships has been expanded from a maximum of 12 to a maximum of 52. This means you can now set your Memberships to bill clients
weekly for up to a year, monthly for a little over 4 years, or yearly for up to 52 years!
To try this, Full Access users can head to Settings > Packages & Memberships and either edit an existing or create a new Membership. In the “
Expires after
” field, you can click the drop-down next to Billing Cycles and choose between 1 and 52.
We hope this helps reduce the admin time and reminders needed to update your clients’ Memberships.
We also updated the way the list of billing events is sorted in the Client Profile > Billing > Packages & Memberships area. You won’t have to do quite so much scrolling to find the most recent billing cycle now, as we’ve defaulted them to sort from most to least recent.
Learn more about setting up your Memberships >
Accessibility Updates
The process of charting with a keyboard or screenreader just got a little bit easier. If a practitioner tabs through the Day View and presses Enter, Jane will now jump over to the Chart Entry area and can interact with the charts there. If they press Esc, Jane will jump back to where they left off in the Day View to continue navigating to the next appointment.

Accessibility:
We’ve made another accessibility improvement, so now anyone navigating with a keyboard won’t unintentionally open the Shift details if the Shift mode is not active.
My Account:
We’ve separated the documents area into pages in your client’s My Account portal to make scanning for information easier, especially for those with a lot of documents.
Chart Entries:
Now you can export chart entries that are missing thumbnails for uploaded Files without any issue.
Fixes:
Online Appointments for Groups:
In some instances, the Hide Self View option would accidentally disappear, so we’ve updated this so that it’s back and ready to use in your next Online Appointment.

Claim Submissions:
We fixed a quirk that was occasionally causing practitioners to accidentally create duplicate electronic claim submissions.
Intake Forms:
We heard that some clients were receiving an error when filling out intake forms with a signature, so we’ve gone ahead and fixed that.
🪄Sometimes when clearing the settings search bar, the sidebar headings occasionally disappeared. Although we love a good magic trick, this is not the time for a disappearing act, so we’ve worked our magic and fixed that.

Accessibility Updates
We’ve made some more improvements to the way Jane works with screen readers. Previously, when looking to open and hop into the Appointment Panel, it took a lot of tabbing through other appointments on the Schedule to get there.
Now, when an appointment is selected, Jane will focus on the Appointment Panel right away. When you’re done with that Appointment Panel, you can hit the escape button and Jane will navigate back to the last appointment that was selected.
We hope this helps make it a lot easier to work with the Schedule for folks using screen readers!
Improvements:
Online Booking
: We tweaked the way each staff member’s name is displayed in the ‘Book by Treatment’ section of your Online Booking site. To match the formatting used on all the other pages, a staff member’s full name will now be shown instead of just their first name. And, to keep things tidy, Jane will switch to saying, “offered by
__
providers” when there are 5+ names listed.
Fixes:
Fullscript
: For a while, Fullscript recommendations weren’t appearing in Print views. We’ve fixed that up and you’ll see those appear as expected now.
System Status
: Did you know that Jane has a status page that can be accessed from the Need Help? menu in your Jane account? Ironically, that link wasn’t working for a little bit, but we’ve got it back up and running for you!

When you’re looking through your Chart Entries from your Staff profile, you now have the ability to use the @ symbol to search a specific client to help you narrow your results and improve the overall performance of your search 🔎.
Insurance Policies
: To make your life a bit easier, you can now sort your entire list of Insurance Policies at once instead of limiting this to 25 policies at a time. Head to
Billing > Insurer Invoices
and select an option to test it out!
Jane Payments
: We’ve updated how we’re saving cards on file through the Jane Payments Terminal, which will fix some scenarios where you told Jane to save the card, but Jane didn’t listen.
TELUS eClaims
: We made the referral date an optional field for Canada Life - PSHCP submissions through TELUS eClaims.
Box 24
: Clinics that bill Medicaid can now send EPSDT referral information in Box 24H of paper (CMS1500) and electronic claims (837p). You can learn more about this change in
our Box 24 guide
.
Jane Support
: We’ve updated our Need Help section to include support hours and instructions so that getting help when you need it is easier.
Accessibility in Jane
: We’re continuing to make improvements so that Jane is more accessible to all users.
We’ve made the waitlist hidden on screen readers when they’re visually hidden on the browser to help reduce auditory noise.
We’ve gone ahead and hidden the onboarding wizard from the screen reader when toggled shut to reduce auditory noise.
We’ve also updated the keyboard shortcuts to improve accessibility and polished up the design so it’s easier to consume.
Fixes
Group Appointments
: We heard that some of your clients found that the start time of a group appointment wasn’t being updated if a change was made to the appointment time during the booking process. So, we’ve gone ahead and updated this so that it’s consistent and accurate for all participants now.

We fixed an issue that was allowing an invalid survey type to be selected when duplicating surveys.
We also added the staff member’s name and set-up date to the survey program history.
Intake Forms
:
We fixed an issue where some clients were not receiving the intake form they were eligible for.
Account Owners now have the ability to change the client on an intake form again.

Changelog: July 6th, 2023
New Arrived Colour
If you had the dark green turned on for your
Arrived + Paid appointments
, you may have noticed that the colours changed a bit.
The shade of green on the appointment is a little lighter and the text is dark grey instead of white.
These new colours were chosen to address
the feedback we received
on the previous colour choices while continuing to meet accessibility standards and call attention to appointments requiring client payment.
This doesn’t address
feedback
on how this feature works with $0 invoices (i.e. with insurance or charging by the unit). We’re still thinking about a better solution for that, so in the meantime, we’ve
built a toggle
(Schedule > ⚙️) that lets you turn the feature off if it’s not helpful for you.
Outcome Measure Surveys
In
Settings > Forms & Surveys
, you can create
Clinical Surveys
that can be set up individually or for all clients. You can enable scoring on your questionnaire to create
Outcome Measure Surveys
, or you can take a peek in our
Template Library
to grab pre-scored surveys (like a PHQ-9 or NDI) added by the community.
Just look for the little 📊 Score icon.
Once your surveys are built, you can head to your
clients’ profiles
to send them
individually
. Surveys can be sent:
Automatically: before or after every in-person visit to your practice
Automatically: on a regular schedule
Manually: whenever you choose, by selecting “
Don’t send automatically
” and then using the
3 dots
under “Action” to either email a new survey or Pass to Client.
🇨🇦 Instant Payouts
Sometimes you need the money you made yesterday… well, yesterday. If you’re in Canada, and have been actively using Jane Payments for a few months, you can now access any pending Jane Payments deposits instantly for an additional 1.5% fee.
To get started, head to
Settings > Jane Payments
and click the
pencil icon
beside your account. You can click
Pay out now
to choose the amount you would like deposited.

Improvements
Treatments
: If you go to edit your treatments/sessions, you’ll notice that the treatment/session name is now at the top of the edit page and on the sticky header as you scroll through the settings so it’s easier to remember which one you’re working on.
Online Appointments for Groups
: We’re continuing to roll out improvements with a recent update that will make it more evident if you fail to connect to a call.
Clinical Surveys
: We’ve made a whole bunch of improvements based on feedback from our Outcome Measure Survey (see above!) beta testers, as well as some initial feedback after the updates went live for everyone.
You can now edit the name & type of a survey after its creation
We removed the need to enable/disable surveys
We enabled the pass-to-client flow for clinic-wide survey programs
We allowed full-access users to archive active surveys
We removed surveys set up as all client surveys (ex. covid screeners) from the patient profile as it was causing some confusion
🇨🇦
TELUS eClaims
:
Customers can now submit claims to PSHCP through the TELUS eClaims integration
Osteopaths and psychotherapists are now eligible to submit claims for their patients through the TELUS eClaims integration to participating insurers
Fixes
Online Appointments for Groups
: We fixed a bug that was causing a participant list to appear where your faces should be when someone shared their screen during a call.
Clinical Surveys
: Some of you were having trouble with the pass-to-client flow on mobile, so we’ve tidied that up and it should be working as expected now.

Changelog: June 12th, 2023
Update: Schedule Accessibility
As part of an ongoing effort to make the Schedule more accessible to our visually impaired users, we’ve made updates to a few components to make them readable by screen readers, like the Date-Picker and Break buttons.
Learn more about Accessibility in Jane >
Update: Wait List Notifications
Jane’s been brushing up on some translation skills! We’ve updated Jane’s Wait List Notification alerts so that they are automatically translated to the language that your account is set to. Now your clients will be alerted that a selected time is no longer available, or to view more availability in the language of your choice. We hope these small changes improve your client’s experience.
Update: Jane is now compatible with Google Analytics 4
On July 1st, Google is replacing Universal Analytics (UA) with
Google Analytics 4
(GA4), so we’ve done some tinkering and our
Google Analytics integration
is now GA4 compatible. If you’re using the integration, make sure to
update your tracking ID
in Jane before
July 1st, 2023
to keep your data flowing smoothly.
Check out our guide to learn more on how you can update your integration >
Note: The integration will be compatible with both UA and GA4 until July 1st when UA will no longer be supported.
Improvements:
Collect Payment for Late Cancellations:
Chasing after payments is no fun task, so we’ve added a Pay button to the Appointment Panel after you’ve selected a late cancellation fee to make it easier for you and your staff to collect payment for appointments that were cancelled too late.
Client Appointment Date Filter:
We were hearing that client profiles with extensive appointment history would sometimes take quite a long time to load up, so we’ve added a date range filter to the appointment list in your client profiles for faster results.
Fixes:
Online Appointments for Groups:
If you were playing around with your screen size during online appointments, you may have noticed that some buttons like screen share were missing when you reduced the size of your screen. We’ve gone ahead and fixed this for you so that now, regardless of your screen size, all desktop users will have access to all desktop functions.
Legal Names on Group Invoices:
We’ve made a few tweaks to our Group Appointment Invoices so that a client’s legal name is shown for other participants rather than their
preferred name
to help meet any legal or insurance-based requirements.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: May 29th, 2023
Update: Treatment/Session drop-down
We heard feedback that the new treatment drop-down we released back in March was too narrow to accommodate some longer treatment names, so we’ve decided to reinstate the previous drop-down style. Along with a wider view, this brings back the ability to select the appointment you’d like to book by typing its first letter on your keyboard.
You’ll still be able to book Group Appointments, Classes, and 1-on-1’s from the same flow, but it looks a little different now.
Improvements:
Insurance Policies Report
: We’ve made a slight change to the
exported
version of our Insurance Policies Report to show clients’ legal names instead of preferred names.
Fixes:
Treatment Ordering
: We resolved an issue where treatments were not showing up in the order they had been configured under Staff Profiles.
Intake Form Reminders
: We fixed an issue where intake form reminders were not being sent when booking appointments administratively.
Billing Codes in Charts
: Last but certainly not least, we’ve embarked on a bug-hunting expedition and emerged victorious! Those mischievous bugs that were causing trouble when syncing billing codes in a chart with an appointment? Well, consider them all squashed!
🔝

Changelog: May 15th, 2023
Updates: Online Gift Cards
We’ve made a few small tweaks to our Online Gift Cards in hopes of providing a better experience for your clients and helping you sell more gift cards:
🔗
A better link to your Online Gift Cards:
This link is easy to share via email or social and can be embedded into your website. It brings clients directly to your Online Gift Card purchase page and keeps them there once they’re signed in. You can head to Settings > Billing Settings > Gift Cards to grab the link.
📧
A quicker way to share Gift Card codes:
There’s now a Send button that will open up your client’s default email browser and pop the Gift Card code into an email along with an editable greeting.
🎁
Better visibility for your Online Gift Cards
: There’s now a shout-out and a link to your Online Gift Cards on the Booking Confirmation page of your Online Booking site.
Online Gift Cards are powered by
Jane Payments
. If you’re not signed up yet, you can learn about our
integrated payments here
. If you’d like to give it a go, head to
Settings > Jane Payments
to
get set up
in 5 minutes.
Let us know
if you have any questions.
Update: Arrived and Paid Colour
Recently, we made a change so that any Arrived appointment with a client-owed balance of $0 will turn dark green.
We heard that some folks would like to be able to turn this on/off, so we’ve made it selectable under your Schedule View Settings ⚙️ (Schedule > click the cog in the bottom right > toggle Differentiate Paid & Arrived States).
Toggling this on/off will only affect your own view of the Schedule/Day sheet. Each staff member in your Jane account can customize their own schedule view.
Improvements:
Insurance Info on Intake Forms
: We’ve added a Skip button to make it easier for clients without insurance to continue on to the rest of their Intake Form.
CPT & Diagnosis Codes
: Things were feeling a little sluggish when you went to re-order diagnosis codes on appointments, so we’ve brewed Jane an extra strong pot of coffee and things should be moving much quicker now.
Online Appointments for Groups
: Speaking of coffee, occasionally folks were finding that their screen would fall asleep during a group telehealth call. Jane should be wide awake now, so you shouldn’t see that happen anymore.
New Discipline
: We’ve added Psychotherapy as a new discipline category.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: May 3rd, 2023
A new colour on your Schedule
When an appointment has been marked as
Arrived
and the
client-owed amount is $0
, it will now turn
dark green
! This will let you see
at a glance
if there are any past appointments that you need to collect payments for.
💚 Light green appointment = Arrived + client balance is
unpaid
🌲 Dark green appointment = Arrived + client balance is
paid
or $0
C
lients may have a $0 balance if their appointment is fully billed to insurance or billed per unit
We really appreciate all of the feedback you provided on this update. We’re working on making this
a selectable option
in your Schedule View settings and will let you know when that’s ready in the next few weeks.
Improvements:
Scorable Surveys
: We’ve added a button to open up the
Chart Template Library
from the Questionnaire section of your
Clinical Surveys
for some quick inspiration and support. We’ve also added some labels to make it easier to find templates with scoring enabled while you’re looking through the library.
CMS1500
and
Superbills
: We’ve made an update to prevent timeout errors when a batch file is taking a little longer to load.
Insurance Info on Intake Forms
: We’ve added a Remove Policy button for your clients when they’re filling out their Intake Forms in case they need to redo the policy they’re adding.
🇨🇦
TELUS eClaims
: In line with a recent TELUS eClaims change, we no longer require or include Client Sex in TELUS eClaim submissions.
🇸🇪
Skål
! Jane can now speak Swedish.
Accessibility improvements to Jane’s Schedule
:
We’ve tweaked the
tabbing
function so that Jane moves through appointments in chronological order and you only have to hit the tab button once each time you want to skip to the next appointment.
The appointment details will also only be read once by screen readers (previously they were read twice).
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: April 19th, 2023
Go big 🔎
This is a small change that will be big for anyone whose appointments are shorter than 30 minutes. You can now increase the zoom-in on your Schedule to
200%.
This will allow you to see all your important appointment details at-a-glance.
To give it a try, you can head to your
Schedule
, click the
cog
in the bottom right corner of your screen, and choose 200% under ‘
Set Schedule Zoom
’.
Improvements
Working with the Schedule
: If there’s a client loaded in the search bar in the top left-hand corner of your Schedule, that client will now change as you click into different appointments. If you don’t want Jane to have an active client loaded, you can remove the client from the search bar using the little ‘x’ beside their name.
Upcoming or Past Appointments
: Previously, when you printed a list of upcoming or past Appointments from your client’s profile (under the Appointments tab), the day of the week was removed. We’ve added this to the printed version so your clients don’t have to refer to a calendar to find out when they saw/will be seeing you next.
Online Appointments for Groups:
Both your
Virtual Background
and
Speaker v. Gallery View Layout
will now be persistent settings. This means that, for example, if you’ve decided to blur your background in one call, it will remain blurred for the next one. Yay for fewer clicks and a little more privacy, wherever you choose to work.
The
Network Strength Indicator
, which shows how strong and stable everyone’s internet is, will now work in all browsers!
Outcome Measures Surveys:
We fixed up an issue that was preventing you from deactivating Clinical Surveys after they were sent to clients.
If you enable scoring on your Clinical Surveys, those will now show on the printed/exported versions of completed surveys.
Insurance:
🇺🇸
Billing Codes
: We tightened a few things up under the hood to make your most frequently used billing codes load a little quicker when you search for them.
🇨🇦
TELUS eClaims
: We’ve added Simply Benefits as a new insurer.
Reporting Improvements:
Prefixes: We added your Staff prefixes like Dr. or Ms. (
if you choose to include them
) to a number of reports.
Top Clients Report
: We added the options to export to CSV and Excel formats. Woohoo!
🔝

Changelog: March 20th, 2023
One booking workflow to rule them all 💍
Last week, we made a change that allows you to book
all
of your appointment types (
Group Appointments, Classes, and 1:1s
) by clicking on the Schedule and choosing the appointment from the
Treatment/Session drop-down
on the Appointment panel.
To make this change possible, you’ll notice we had to do a little switcharoo of the
Treatment and Patient fields
. ⤵️
💭
Previously, the only way to book a Group Appointment or Class was to select it under the staff name on the left and drop it onto the schedule (you can still do this if you’d like).
Some of our community provided quick feedback on a few unintended changes with this feature, so we’ve started working on those. Thanks so much to everyone who let us know if something wasn’t feeling quite right. 💙
🚀 We’ve fixed up the way you add an insurance policy when booking an appointment so Jane behaves as expected whether you choose to add the Patient or the Treatment first.
🔜 We had omitted some info about a Patients last appointment, so we’re going to add all of that back in.
🔜 We heard that the Treatment drop-down was too narrow to accommodate some longer Treatment names, so we’re working on ensuring everything fits on one line.
Update: Credit Cards on Intake Forms
The credit card collection field on your Intake Forms can now be made
required
. 🙌
Clients will only be asked to complete this step if there isn’t already a credit card connected to their account. If you’d like to turn this on, you can head to
Settings > Forms & Surveys > Intake Forms
and edit your form.
Thanks so much to everyone who provided their feedback on how this change would be helpful. If you’re not using
Jane Payments

Improvements
Sales Report
: We’ve added a No Charge filter option so you can get a more complete overview of your appointments.
Outcome Measure Surveys
: We’ve made an update that lets you see the total score when you’re looking at an open Chart Entry.
Online Appointments for Groups
We added a banner to the waiting room that helps clients and providers feel confident they’ve got their microphone and camera permissions enabled. We hope this saves you from getting really good at miming to your clients to enable their microphones. 🎙️
You now have Persistent Settings for your camera, speaker, and microphone inputs/outputs! This means that Jane will remember if you joined your last appointment with your headphones/webcam/external speakers and automatically use those if you have them connected to your computer when you join a call.
Fixes
Self Check-In
: We fixed an issue where SMS Self Check-In links would expire immediately for Android users.

Outcome Measure Surveys
We’re excited to be releasing the first part of this feature because we know it will be helpful for so many of you, and we can’t wait for you to see what’s coming soon!
🎉 Here’s what you can do with
Outcome Measure Surveys
right now:
Enable scoring for your checkboxes, sliders, or drop-downs on a Clinical Survey (Settings > Forms & Surveys ) and let Jane do the math for you when an Outcome Measure Survey is completed.
Use an Outcome Measure Survey for an individual client by
adding it to their chart
as a Chart Entry and filling it in on their behalf. You can make sure your surveys appear when you click New Chart Entry by going to your Staff Profile > Templates > Surveys.
Automatically send a survey to
all clients
before or after
all appointments
or at the time of
booking.
💌
Here’s what’s coming soon:
Sending Outcome Measure Surveys to
individual clients
, either manually or automatically.
The ability to share templates that include scoring in the Chart Template Library.
Demo Clinic Password

Demo Clinic
where you can
play with new features
and
test out workflows

menu.
Improvements
Late Cancellations
: We’ve made an update so that Late Cancellations appear as line items on your Product Performance report (just like No-Shows).
Online Appointments for Groups
:
Virtual backgrounds
(with Chrome browser only): We’ve added a few virtual background options, so you can now join your call from the ocean, the forest, or even outer space. 💫
Network indicator
: Can you hear me now? Similar to how you can check for bars on your cellphone, you can now check for bars on a video call. We’ve added an icon to the upper right-hand corner of your screen to help you see how strong your internet is. You’ll also receive a notification if you experience a significant drop in your connection.
Reports
:
The
Adjustments Report
can now be exported to CSV and Excel.
The
Sales Report
has a new income state filter for Partially Paid invoices.

Changelog: February 21st, 2023
Online Appointments for Groups
You can now host HIPAA, PIPEDA, and GDPR-compliant online sessions for 2-12 related clients, without leaving Jane. This is an
optional add-on to any Jane plan, at $15 per practitioner per month.
This will be great for sessions with multiple clients who know each other, like family and couples therapy—
we’re still working on creating a great experience for unrelated groups and classes
. 1:1 Online Appointments will continue to be free for everyone. 🎉
We’ve added some exciting features like blurred backgrounds, a session timer, chat, hand raising, and hi-def video.
Learn more about Online Appointments for Groups >
Our goal has always been to keep Jane affordable for you and that hasn’t changed. Adding extra participants to a telehealth session is (surprisingly!) expensive for us to run. So, by adding a flat rate per practitioner, we’re trying to ensure that you only pay for those in your practice who will use it and that we can continue to build great features for you.
As always, we’d love to hear your feedback so we can continue to grow and make sure you’re getting great value for the cost of Jane.
Improvements
We’ve added a new loading message: A Ralph Waldo Emerson quote that Ali, our co-founder, loves. Let us know if you see it the next time to log on! 👀
Shifts
: You can now feed two birds with one scone and delete any breaks that exist within a Shift when that Shift is deleted.
Intake Form Reminders
: We’ve added an automatic reminder for Intake Forms that are sent manually and are incomplete 24 hours before the client’s next appointment.
Fixes
Late Cancellations
: We heard that the way the new invoicing option for Late Cancellations was being billed to clients’ insurance wasn’t working for some practices. We fixed that up so that Late Cancellation invoices act a bit more like No-Shows and assume the client will be responsible for the cost.
Treatments/Sessions
: We fixed a quirk where Jane lost track of the order of Treatments when there was a long list of them. Your Treatments should all stay in the order you left them from now on.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: February 6th, 2023
🇺🇸 Update: Improved Statement Filtering
In addition to our
recent updates to Diagnosis Codes on Statements
, we’ve added a 3rd filter option to exclude Diagnosis Codes altogether. When selected, this filter produces Statements that show only CPT codes and insurance details.
Improvements
Reporting Improvements
:
Sales Report
: We took the Sales Report in for its annual service so when you go to export it, that clanking under the hood should be gone (aka it should load a little quicker for you 😉).
Online Appointment Usage Report
: This report can now be exported to Excel/CSV to allow you to dive a little deeper into your usage.
Unapplied & Applied Payments Report
: We’ve improved the date formats on this report so that they’re easier to sort when exported to Excel.
Activity Log
: If you’ve ever come across a log item saying
, “So-and-so
destroyed
on Tuesday at 12 pm
”, you’ve likely thought to yourself, “… destroyed
what
, Jane?!”. We’ve been there. So, we asked Jane to provide a little more context (i.e. “destroyed a Shift”) to help prevent confusion.
Disciplines
: We’ve separated the Kinesiology/Athletic Therapy Discipline into 2 separate Disciplines— Kinesiology
and
Athletic Therapy. ✌️ To update your Discipline, you can head to Settings > Disciplines and click edit. Then, you can choose the appropriate Discipline from the Category drop-down list.
If you use Online Booking, you may also need to edit your
Name
and
Professional title
to update what displays to the public. If you’re not sure which title you should be using, we encourage you to reach out to your regulatory body.
PCI Compliance
: To help you maintain PCI compliance, we’ve added a warning that appears if you try to type a credit card number into a Chart Entry. It will prevent you from Signing the Chart Entry until the card number is removed. For more info, you can check out our update
from last week
. ⤵️
Fixes
Relationships
: We’ve tidied up an issue where duplicate emails were being sent when a new Relationship was created. Clients should now only receive a single, consolidated update when you set up their Relationship.
🔝

Changelog: January 23rd, 2023
Improved PCI Compliance
If you’re not familiar with
PCI Compliance
, it’s a standard to ensure business owners are maintaining safe payments for their clients, including proper storage of credit card information.
Jane is a secure platform for storing clients’ data, but it can still be used in ways that are not PCI-compliant, like collecting and storing credit card numbers in plain text in chart entries.
To help you maintain compliance, we’ll be
removing the ability to record credit card information in charting fields
(
including Intake Forms
) by
January 31st.
📆 Similar to other note fields in Jane, any 16-digit number will be replaced with stars once saved.
🎉
Jane Payments
is PCI compliant
and allows you to easily collect and store credit card info in three ways:
Collect Credit Cards through Online Booking
Collect Credit Cards on Intake Forms
Collect Credit Cards using the Jane Payments Terminal

Better Cancellations in Jane
We made 3 updates that will make managing and tracking cancelled appointments better:
⌚
Late Cancellation Invoices:
You can now
set custom fees
for your late cancellations, just like you have for No-Shows (
Settings > Fees
)!
Once set, these fee options will be available during the Late Cancellation Period when you click the Cancel button on an appointment.
💬
Reason for Cancellation
:
As you cancel an appointment, you’ll notice your Reasons for Cancellation now appear in a pop-out box.
This includes a new “Other” option that allows you to add specific reasons as needed for easier-to-track cancellations.
⏪ Undo a Cancellation:
Finally, once that appointment has been cancelled, you can now reverse the cancellation if it was done in error.
These are small changes that we hope make a big impact!
Learn more >
Intake Form Reminders
Speaking of making a big impact (drum roll, please 🥁)… Every Intake Form will now include an
automated email reminder that will be sent 24 hours before an appointment
if the form is incomplete!
We hope this helps reduce the amount of time you spend emailing clients and ensures more appointments start with completed forms.
Learn more >
Improvements:
The Sales Report
: We made a tweak to the Sales Report to show partially paid invoices when the All Outstanding filter is selected. This should make the math a little math-ier for you.
Diagnosis Codes on Statements
: We changed the way that diagnosis codes are formatted on receipts, invoices, and statements (
but not superbills
) by removing the diagnosis code description and separating all codes by commas (instead of having one per row).
You’ll see these changes applied to purchases invoiced after January 9th.
Procedure Codes
: After updating the price of a procedure code, you can now edit that procedure code on an existing appointment to update the price. To do this, click Change Billing Code and re-select the same procedure.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: January 9th, 2023
Update:
Mailing Client Statements
We’ve reformatted the clinic address on
Printed (Mail)
Client Statements to fit within the return address window of double-window envelopes. We hope this saves you a little time (and ink or stickers) when mailing out your statements!
Improvements
Billing Codes
: We’ve done a little tinkering under the hood so that Jane pulls up your custom, favourited, and most relevant Procedures and Diagnosis codes a little quicker when searched.
Chart Templates
: You can now duplicate Chart Parts when you’re building or editing your templates for quicker, easier template creation!
Translations
:
We’ve cleaned up some of our translations
en français
in our cancellation emails and the “Welcome back” message in Online Booking
We’ve added labels for the required fields on Intake Forms
en español
🇺🇸
Electronic claims (837)
: Jane can now support Supervising and Ordering providers on electronic claims! Previously, both were communicated as Referring providers, which occasionally caused a rejection. We hope this makes your billing a little smoother.

Statements
: We increased the font size of the mailing address from 12px to 14px to make our printed snail mail Statements a little easier on your mail delivery person’s eyes.
🇺🇸
Insurance Billing
: We did a little tinkering under the hood and souped-up Jane’s performance when posting EOBs, and generating individual superbills and CMS1500s. Zoom zoom.
Fixes
Wait List
: Jane was doing a little interior design work and accidentally turned the Wait List bubble green. Those bubbles are back to their cheery orange once again.
Forms and Surveys
: The new Settings screen for Intake Forms, Clinical Surveys, and Rating & Reviews, wasn’t formatted for medium-sized screens (like a tablet). That’s all fixed up now, and you’ll be able to work on those from whichever device you like.

Save Credit Cards from the Jane Payments Terminal
You can now optionally save a credit card on file when your client taps, swipes, or inserts their card into your

Pay Balance Texts (SMS)
Raise your hand if your inbox is a little… messy these days. 🙋‍♀️Jane’s got you covered: Cut through the clutter by sending a
Pay Balance Text Message
using
Jane Payments
. You can add a personalized message while sending your client a secure link to pay their outstanding balance. Clients can pay from anywhere through their client portal with a card-on-file, or Apple or Google Pay.
Making it easier for clients to pay means a better chance of you getting paid, sooner. Read more about this and other ways clients can
Pay Balances Online.
Improvements:
Searching Charts
: You might notice that the search function in your charts has been even more helpful recently (and if you haven’t, give it a try!). We’ve added a little extra logic to Jane so you can spend less time flipping through charts and more time getting ready for your next client.
Deleting Client Files
: Account Owners can now delete files from a client’s Files tab, regardless of who uploaded them, as long as it isn’t included in the client’s Chart.
Fixes:
Electronic Claim Submission
: We fixed an issue with the way staff phone numbers were formatted in electronic submissions (837) that would occasionally trigger a clearinghouse rejection. If you’ve ever been given a fake phone number, you’ll understand the feeling. 😉
Pay Balance Emails
: For a brief time, Jane wasn’t allowing some practitioners to send Pay Balance Emails, even if they had the Access Billing permission selected in their Staff Profiles. We’ve reminded Jane that anyone with that box ticked should be allowed to collect payments, so things should be back to normal now.

Settings Page Redesign
Jane has grown up a lot over the past few years, so the Settings list has gotten longer and each page within that has gotten a little busier. To help make it easier to manage your Jane account, our team is embarking on a Settings Redesign journey. We’ve got two exciting changes for you this week:
#1: Clinic Info & Locations
We’ve started with the first place most people land when they’re getting set up:
Clinic Info & Locations.
We’ve broken this page into 2 separate tabs (Clinic Info, Locations) to keep things clearer and easier to manage as you add/edit some of the most essential information about your practice.
#2: Intake Forms, Clinical Surveys, and Ratings & Reviews
We’ve also built a new home for the setup of your client forms and surveys (Intake Forms, Clinical Surveys, Reviews & Ratings). These are now conveniently grouped together in the
Forms and Surveys
tab.

Fixes:
Charting on an iPad
: If you were trying to access a chart from the Day view on an iPad recently, you may have noticed Jane wasn’t being quite as helpful as usual. We’ve done a little tinkering, and your charts should open as normal again.
Improvements:
🇺🇸
Secondary Claim Submission
: We added some messaging for when a primary claim response isn’t automatically added to a secondary claim. Reasons include:
🙅 The primary payer forwarded the secondary claim on the clinic’s behalf
🙅 The primary response should not be used for billing secondaries
🙅 The procedures in the primary response don’t match the procedures on the claim
🙅 There is another ‘valid’ primary response with a more recent effective date

UK Insurance
: We’ve made a few more updates to insurance policy terms for our mates in the UK. This is a small part of our ongoing work to build better regional insurance features in Jane.

Payments for Related Clients
Do your clients want to pay all the invoices for their family visit with a single transaction? Or would they like to pay their child’s invoice and be reflected as the payer? Good news: You can now do both in Jane. 🎉
This new way to pay uses Jane’s Relationship feature to create a more streamlined checkout for you and your clients, as well as more accurate receipts and statements.
Learn all about how you can get going with Payments for Related Clients!
Charting for Classes or Group Appointments
To streamline the workflow for those seeing multiple clients at once, we’ve created a shortcut that allows you to copy a signed Chart Entry from one client’s chart to another’s.
This option will appear on any Chart Entry with a Class or Group Appointment attached to it. If you need a refresher on attaching Chart Entries to appointments,
you can check this guide out
!
We hope this makes your charting for Groups and Classes a little easier.

Canadian Insurance Integrations
: There was a little bug that was allowing users to accidentally double-submit claims to TELUS eClaims or Pacific Blue Cross. We asked it to pack up its things and go, so it shouldn’t be pestering anyone anymore.
Improvements
Settings Search Bar:
Jane just got smarter! We’ve been working on expanding Jane’s vocab when it comes to searching your Settings. You can now type in all sorts of things that you remember seeing (
somewhere
in the Settings) and Jane will pull it up for you. 💪
Editing Quick-Click Chart Parts
: We’ve made it a whole lot easier to edit your checkboxes, drop-downs, range scales, and Smart Options & Narratives. You can now drag and drop items into place, rather than rewriting your list of options. Happy editing!

US Insurance: Secondary Claim Management in Jane
There’s a new workflow in town and it will make managing your secondary claims in Jane so much better. That includes billing secondary submissions electronically.
Starting
October 18th
here’s what you’ll see:
📂 All
new
secondary claims will automatically be put into the
Waiting on Primary
claim submission folder
A
ny existing secondary claims (generated before October 18th) will remain in their current folder
🚀 Once the primary claim is marked
Approved
, Jane will
move the secondary claim
to your
Draft or Unsubmitted
claim folder (based on your Billing Settings)
💪 If you submit to Insurers that automatically forward secondary claims for you (like Medicare), you can indicate that in
Settings > Insurers
and Jane will automatically mark your secondary claims as Submitted at the same time as the primary
🪄 If you upload
ERAs
, Jane will
automagically
fill in the primary remittance information
that’s required to bill secondary claims
You can
check out our guide
for all the details!
Improvements:
Primary Phone Number
: You can now indicate your client’s primary phone number in their profile so you have a visual cue telling you which number to call first! We hope this makes it a little easier for you to get in touch with your clients (on the first try 😉).
🇺🇸
Locations
: Jane now includes Armed Forces Americas (AA), Armed Forces Europe (AE), or Armed Forces Pacific (AP) in the State drop-down options for Client Profiles, Staff Profiles, and Clinic Locations.
Fixes:
Credit cards on Intake Forms
: Jane was displaying the cancellation policy on the Credit Card section of your Intake Forms in seconds instead of hours. While we appreciate the attention to detail, we’ve asked Jane to zoom out a little to make the policy easier to understand.

Effective October 1st, we’ve added 1176 new billable diagnosis codes to the ICD10 set in accordance with

. Once enabled, clients without a card on file will be asked to add their card info the next time they’re prompted to fill out an Intake Form.
Credit card info entered on Intake Forms will be stored as a
secure token

🆕 Billing Notices on your clients’ Profile

🇺🇸 Session/Treatment-Specific Place of Service Codes
If you need to
bill or provide superbills using more than one Place of Service (POS) code
, you can now set a default POS code for your practice, as well as specific codes for any services that require it!
In your
Location Settings,
you can set a code that will apply to all Sessions/Treatments that don’t have a specific POS code added, and in your
Sessions/Treatments Settings,
you can enter a code that will only apply to that specific appointment type.
This update was inspired by practices
billing/providing superbills for Telehealth and in-person visits
, but will be helpful for anyone who needs to use different POS codes from a single Location in their Jane account!
Learn all about it in our Setting a Place of Service Code guide!
Thanks so much to our community members who helped us understand this pain point!
We love that we get to grow Jane alongside you.
💙 This is another step towards making Jane the best it can be for those of you billing insurance and providing superbills.
Improvements:
Insurance Info on Intake Forms
: We’ve tweaked the insurance collection step on intake forms to make it a little more streamlined. Your client’s address will now automatically pre-populate with what they’ve entered on the previous page, saving them from having to enter that info in twice.
Groups
: When we added our shiny new Group section to the client Profile, we didn’t realize we had added it right where the Chart option used to be. We’ve moved it along so you can continue to chat with your clients, grab your equipment, and navigate Jane at the same time without stumbling upon something unexpected.
Wait List Notifications
: We’ve made an update so that Wait List Notifications will work according to each client’s
Online Booking Policy
. So, any Wait List client with Online Booking disabled will receive notifications telling them to call to book, while any Wait List client with Online Booking enabled will receive an email that lets them choose an opening online!
🇺🇸
ERA Management
: Jane now displays insurer Remarks (Remittance Advice Remark Codes), for those of you uploading ERAs. When an insurer sends Remarks, you’ll find them under the Messages column in the Claim Response screen. Our goal is for you to never have to leave Jane to bill insurance, and this is one small, remark-able step in that direction. 😉

🆕 Group Appointments
Tandem bikes, paddling a canoe, moving a couch… some things are just better when you get to do them with others. That’s why we’re so excited to announce that you now have the ability to schedule
Group Appointments
in Jane! 🎉 This allows you to book multiple clients into a single session with a single invoice.
We’re still hard at work on a few more goodies to help with your Group Appointments (Group Telehealth and Group Billing are coming this Fall!), so stay tuned for those in the coming months.

Gift Cards
: For a long time, gift card-related transactions were excluded from the Statement in a client’s Billing profile, resulting in a balance that didn’t accurately reflect what was shown in their profile or what they really owed. We’ve made some tweaks and things are now perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
🔝

Changelog: August 8th, 2022
Update: Insurance Policy Viewing
When you go to view a client’s Insurance Policy, you’ll now be able to see a lot more info at-a-glance!
We’ve added details like the policy holder’s relationship to the insured (along with their name and DOB), the Prior Authorization Number, Insurance Plan Name, and default coverage amounts. We hope this removes a few extra clicks from your billing workflows.
🇺🇸 Removing an Insurance Policy from an Appointment
We added an extra safeguard for anyone trying to remove an Insurance Policy from an Arrived appointment after a claim has already been submitted.
Now, Jane will pop up to let you know how many claims have already been submitted and remind you that deleting it will also delete the claim, unlink associated responses, and delete all submissions. Better safe than sorry!
Improvements
Account Activity Notifications
: We’re always working to make Jane even more secure, so over the coming months, you and your clients will start to notice heads-up emails that are sent from Jane whenever a password, email, or address is changed, or when there’s a login to an account from a new device.
Fixes
Signing & Locking a Chart Entry
: The lock that appears on your Day sheet to let you know whether a Chart Entry has been signed got a little sticky. It wasn’t locking until you refreshed your page, so we sprayed some WD-40 on it and it’s back to snapping shut as soon as you hit that Sign button. 🔒

Managing your Jane Subscription
We’re making it easier to
update your Jane subscription
as you add/reactivate and delete/deactivate Staff members in your Jane account! Jane will ask a few quick questions to help automatically increase or decrease your license count as needed. Whenever the license count is changed, the Account Owner will receive an email letting them know. Account Owners can still manually update their subscription from Settings > Jane Subscription, as well, but this should help remove a few extra clicks from the process!
We’ll be rolling this out over the next couple of weeks, so if you don’t see it in your account quite yet, you can check back soon!
Improvements
Emails
: We’ve made Emails that are sent from Jane easier to read by changing the text colour to add a little more contrast.
Jane’s System Status Page
: We’ve improved our System Status page to keep you up to date in the (rare!) event that Jane is having a bad day. With this update, we can send notifications directly to your Jane account if a feature or integration you use is temporarily down.
Fixes
🥷
Privacy Mode
: There were a few places that Jane was forgetting to blur when in Privacy Mode (Shift + P), like certain spots on the Sales Report, Purchase View, or Patient Profile Billing area. We’ve fixed that up so you don’t have to worry about anyone peeking over your shoulder, no matter which part of Jane you’re working in.
Mailchimp
: Emails that were entered into Jane using capital letters weren’t syncing to Mailchimp for anyone using the integration. We’ve asked Jane to be a little less case-sensitive and your client’s emails should sync without issue moving forward.

Update: Pronouns
We’ve added an option to your Clinic Info & Location Settings to
enable/disable
pronouns
in your clients’
My Account
. We’ve decided to put this back in your hands so that, by giving your clients the option to update their pronouns, you’re able to more intentionally signal whether or not you can provide inclusive care.
Improvements
Online Booking Branding
: We know you work hard on your branding, and we always want to respect that. We’ve made some updates to ensure the logo you upload to your Online Booking site is as crisp and clear as can be.
Intake Forms
: The Online Intake Form section of your Clients’ Profile shows you all of their completed and pending Intake Forms. We had originally named the column that shows whether a form has been completed or not “Submitted”, which turns out was a little optimistic. 😉 It’s now called “Status” to more accurately reflect the information being provided.
Fixes
Schedule View
: We noticed that client’s prefixes were not reliably showing up on the schedule. We pulled Jane aside and explained that if someone spends 10-15 years in school to get their PhD or MD, the least we can do is refer to them as “Dr.”

Accept Tips with the Jane Payments Terminal
We know that asking if someone wants to tip after a treatment can be, well, a little awkward. That’s why we’re so excited that you can now set up your Jane Payments Terminal to prompt your clients for you!
You can even set some standard tip amounts (ex. 10%, 12%, 15%) along with the option to add a custom tip or skip it altogether. You can also turn off tips during a particular client’s check out if it doesn’t feel like an appropriate time to have that prompt appear. 💸 We hope this helps you make a little extra cash (and avoid those awkward conversations!).

Update: Client Statements
If you’re someone who works with client Statements in Jane, this one might make you go, “ooh!” and maybe even, “ahh!”. These small but mighty updates will be great for everyone, but we hope they’re especially helpful for our friends in the U.S. who deal with insurance. 💪
Here’s what’s new:
👀 We’ve
moved the Summary to the top
of the Statement, so it’s above all the nitty-gritty details. This way, you and your clients will be able to see the most important info at-a-glance.
🧾 Speaking of nitty-gritty details, we’ve added a
new filter option: Exclude Insurance Details
which will remove all the insurance bits and bobs (like CPT codes, ICD10 codes, co-pay, etc.) to help keep your Statements from being longer than a CVS receipt.
📫 For anyone who sends their Statements in the mail, we’ve also added a
Print (Mail) option
so the client’s name and address will
fit into the window of a #10 envelope
when folded!
We hope these changes are helpful for you and your clients!
Improvements
Chart Entries
: We’ve added a new Filter option that allows you to sort a client’s Chart Entries by newest first or oldest first! Then, if you go to Export the chart, it will print or create a PDF in the order you’ve chosen.
Language Settings
: Jane is learning a new language! You can now search using Japanese characters and, if you head to Clinic Info & Locations and set your locale to Japan, Jane will translate some key parts of your account into Japanese (including your Online Booking site). Arigatou to our clinic in Japan for their patience and assistance with this. 🙏
Memberships
: We made Memberships a bit more flexible. You can now apply a Membership to an appointment even if the billing cycle for that appointment time is unpaid! Jane will give you a friendly heads up but will allow you and your clients to book any eligible sessions regardless.
Write-Offs
: We’ve taken a cue from Missy Elliot and worked it so that you can now take a
partially
written-off invoice, flip it and reverse it. This will revert the invoice back to the initial balance, saving you a step in the process.
Fixes
Wait List Notifications
: A bug was causing staff members’ post-treatment time to be added on top of a treatment’s scheduled time when a client claimed a spot on the Wait List. We politely asked the little nuisance to pack its things and go, so there shouldn’t be any more treatment length confusion for your Wait List clients.
Intake Forms
: We’ve fixed up an issue where Intake Forms that still need to be completed weren’t appearing in clients’
My Account
. Now, your clients should be able to log in and see their pending Intake Forms (and hopefully complete them 😉).

Update: Jane Payments Cut-Off Time
The new cutoff time for
Jane Payments
is 11:59 pm ET / 8:59 pm PT.
🎉
This means that all payments processed before 11:59 pm for our East Coasters and 8:59 pm for those of us out West will be deposited into your account at the same time. Say goodbye to having payments from the same calendar day split into two deposits on two separate days! We hope this helps make your bookkeeping a little easier.
New: Settings Search Bar 🔎
Over the years, as Jane has grown up, our Settings list has grown too. So, we’ve introduced a search bar to help you quickly find what you’re looking for! Right now, you’ll need to type in the specific Settings tab you’d like to pull up, but soon you’ll be able to type in keywords for whatever you’re looking to do and Jane will show you where to go! Pretty neat, hey?
Update: Formatting for Phrases
You can now
add formatting
to your Phrases: Create a list, include some links, or even add a little
emphasis
! You can add or edit Phrases from your Staff profile. Learn all about
using phrases for faster charting here
!
Improvements
Passwords
: You know when you’re typing in a password and you think you’ve made a typo so you have to delete everything and start over? Well, you won’t have to do that in Jane anymore! We’ve added the
option
to make your password visible as you type it in, so you can create super long, complex passwords and not worry about entry errors. 💪
Insurance Policy Reset
: We’ve added a little extra info to the policy reset confirmation screen to explain the criteria for resetting a policy. We’ve also updated the success message when policies are reset to show the number of insurance policies that were reset, instead of just displaying the total number of policies that were selected.
Insurance Info on Intake Forms
: Did you know clients can’t upload their insurance info to an intake form as a PDF? We realized that wasn’t super clear, so we’ve added a note to the upload area so clients know which file types
can
be uploaded (jpeg, jpg, and png). To make sure the message is loud and clear, we’ve added that info to the error message someone will see if they try to upload an incompatible file as well.
🇨🇦
TELUS eClaims
: Registered Social Workers and Occupational Therapists are now able to submit claims through Jane’s TELUS eClaims integration!

Jane Payments
: We’ve redesigned the Settings area so that everything you need to know or take action on is easier to find in fewer clicks.
Time Zones
: For anyone using Jane’s ‘Display Clinic Time Zone’ feature, we’ve continued to add to the list of places that Jane will display Time Zones for clients, including on Wait List Requests!
Arrive/No Show
: You click Arrive so many times a day (and No Show hopefully a little less), so every extra second you spend waiting for Jane to turn that appointment green (or red) counts! We’ve made some behind-the-scenes updates to make that process speedier than ever, and we hope it saves you a little extra time each day.
Client Sign-up Form
: We’ve improved the order we displayed First Name, Last Name, Preferred Name, and Pronouns on the client sign-up form.
🇺🇸
Claim Submission Folders
: We added a fancy new ‘Related Claims’ section to the Claim Summary panel in your Claim Submission Folders. Now, when you click View on a primary claim in any submission folder, you can scroll down and see if the client also has secondary coverage (and vice versa!).
Fixes
Return Visit Reminders
: Jane was having some trouble with time management and wasn’t sending out RVRs that were scheduled on the same day they were set to send. We’ve fixed that up now and your reminders will be sent, no matter when you’re scheduling them.
Wait List Notifications
: We trapped a bug that was causing Wait List Notification cues to pop up for appointments scheduled outside of shifts. We’ve shooed that little pest out the window and they will only appear for appointments within a shift from now on.
Products
: Occasionally, if someone changed the quantity of a product being sold really quickly, Jane had a little trouble keeping the inventory up-to-date. We’ve introduced a little extra caffeine to the morning routine, and Jane now has all the necessary energy to track even the quickest of clickers!

The wait for better Wait List management is over! Wait List Notifications will hold any cancelled, deleted, no-showed, or moved appointment times for your Wait List clients whose availability and preferences fit within that spot. Then, you’ll be able to send all those clients an SMS and/or Email notification, book in a specific client, or release the spot back to the general public.
If you enable automatic notifications, you can sit back and relax while Jane manages your Wait List for you! We hope this helps you keep your schedules full and see your clients sooner.

TELUS eClaims
: We’ve also added the
Nova Scotia College of Audiologists and Speech-Language Pathologists
as a selectable licensing body for TELUS eClaims!
🇺🇸
U.S. Claim Submission Folders
:
Claims in the
Approved and Search folders
will now be shown in
descending
order by service date, meaning you’ll see your most recent claims at the top! Say, ‘see ya later’ to those old claims you’ve been seeing for so long.
We also added a new
Claim Type
filter so it’s super easy to find all those secondary claims (or filter them out so you can just select primaries!).
Fixes
Charting
: We searched high and low and found a pesky bug that would clear a Chart Entry if a practitioner used
Google translate
in the charting area. We can’t promise Jane will always understand what you’re saying, but if you choose to translate directly in your charts, the entry will stay intact.
🇨🇦
TELUS eClaims
: Some
claim reversal requests
(particularly for Desjardins) were being rejected due to rounding of cents in the total billed amount. It turns out every penny really does count! We’ve sorted that out and it won’t hold up your claim reversals any longer.

Improvements
Timezones
: You can now update your Online Booking Settings to display your clinic timezone for your clients! Your timezone acronym (like PST, EST) will appear on your Online Booking site and in all appointment-related emails. We hope this helps avoid miscommunications for anyone working with clients outside of your timezone!
The Compensation Report
: Some of you were asking for an easier way to understand how Jane was arriving at the commission value totals shown within this report, so we updated the exported version to include a per-line breakdown of commission rates, subtotals, and totals. This update will also provide additional flexibility for clinics that may want to perform their own calculations on the compensation data!
Setting up your Jane Account
: We’ve added the ability for Account Owners to easily navigate back to Optional Tasks in the Onboarding Wizard in case you want to redo them. Thanks to everyone who requested this small change that we hope will make a big impact on how you learn to use Jane. 💙
Fixes
Locations
: If you’ve ever gotten lost with a map in your hand, you’ll know how Jane was feeling recently. For a while, the map in the Clinic Locations Settings wasn’t updating to match the address that was typed in. We’ve got this all fixed up now!

Memberships
: We haven’t quite figured out time travel yet, but Jane has! You can now
backdate
a Membership when you sell it, and Jane will generate all the past billing cycle invoices accordingly. In keeping with the number one rule of time travel, these past invoices won’t be processed automatically to avoid any expensive surprises in the present (or future 😉).
Refunds
: We found that lots of bookkeeping headaches were happening due to payment refunds accidentally being edited
and
that it’s pretty rare that someone actually needs to do that. So, we’ve removed the option to edit, and if you ever need to do so, the Jane team will be more than happy to hop in and help you out.
🇨🇦
Canadian Insurance Integrations
: Jane pulled out the ol’ label maker and got busy. You’ll find some new insurer labels that help you see integrations (like Pacific Blue Cross, Teleplan, and TELUS eClaims) at-a-glance when saving a new Insurance Policy.
Fixes
Receipts
: Sometimes, the detailed receipts would show ‘Credit Card’ when an Interac Debit card was used, so we’ve fixed that up to make sure all your receipts are accurate.
🇨🇦
Teleplan
: Jane was having a bit of trouble submitting Teleplan claims from a client’s Insurance Policy area. We fixed that up, so you can once again submit your Teleplan claims from wherever works best for you.

Improvements
Jane Payments:
Some of the
French translations
in our Jane Payments area were… pas bon. We signed Jane up for Duolingo, and hopefully Jane parle mieux le français maintenant.
It looks like Jane’s putting that Duolingo to good use because you can now
search Clients and Staff
using
non-Latin alphabets,
like Japanese and Chinese!
Privacy & Security:
We made Jane a little bit safer by requiring your password before you can change your
Mobile Phone Number
in your Staff Profile (and the same for Clients in their My Account!). Just another layer of security to keep your accounts safe and sound.
🇺🇸
Electronic Claim Submission:
Our clinics located in the
US Virgin Islands and other US territories
can now submit claims electronically!
🇺🇸
U.S. Insurance Submission Folders:
After receiving some feedback that you were missing the
at-a-glance
ability to check if billing codes had been added to an appointment, we added two new columns to the Claim Submission folders:
Procedures & Diagnosis Codes.
This will make it easier to spot claims that don’t yet have Diagnosis codes or CPT codes added!
Fixes
My Account:
Jane was being a little inconsistent about requiring
home or mobile phone numbers
from Clients when they signed up online. We’ve got that sorted out now, so either a mobile
or
home phone number will be needed.
Privacy & Security:
We snuck in another small security win by
hiding client names that were exposed in the URL
when searching for a Client Profile.
Class Bookings:
We zapped an annoying little bug that was causing any Class Booking placed beside a shift that was set to a “Not Bookable Online” to
also
not be bookable online.

🇺🇸 U.S. Insurance Billing: Claim Submission Folder Update
For all our practices in the U.S. that bill insurance, you’ll notice that your
Claim Submission folders
have gotten a makeover. The core functionality hasn’t changed, but there are a few changes that we know will make your insurance billing go so much smoother.
There’s a new Claim Summary panel that shows you everything you need to know about a claim at-a-glance. We’ve added checkboxes that you can use to select your claims for submission and a summary at the bottom of the page to show you how many you’ve chosen, from how many different insurers, and whether they’re primary or secondary claims. We’ve also moved the big orange submit button from the top of the screen to the bottom right, for a more intuitive experience. 🎉 Let us know what you think!
Improvements
My Account
: We’ve updated the Documents section of your Client’s My Account to display files in order from newest to oldest. For your clients, this means no more scrolling through dozens of surveys to find the info you’ve just shared! A small but mighty change. 💪
Memberships
: We realized the way we initially set Memberships up was a little restrictive, so we’ve made some tweaks to allow you to redeem them for past appointments. This way, if a Membership accidentally gets removed or is missed for an appointment, you can go back and apply it as needed.
Class Booking
: Previously, if a client booked into a class through your Online Booking site, Jane didn’t update your admin Schedule until the booking was completely finalized. Now, the class booking will update in real-time as soon as a client initiates the booking process so that there’s no chance of overbooking your class.
Chart Templates
: We’ve given Full Access users the ability to delete system (clinic-wide) chart templates like, for example, that SOAP note no one is using anymore.
🇺🇸
New Insurance Policies
: Previously, if a ‘Date of Current Illness, Injury, or Pregnancy’ had been added to an insurance policy, we didn’t
require
that you select a date type. If no date type was selected, we assumed it was an ‘Onset of Current Symptoms of Illness’ date when generating claim submissions. To help with the accuracy of your submissions moving forward, we’ll require that the date type is selected before saving new insurance policies that have a ‘Date of Current Illness, Injury, or Pregnancy’.
Fixes
Packages
and
Memberships
: We’ve updated the way Jane copies appointments on the Schedule. Now, if you Copy an appointment that is part of a Package or Membership that your client has purchased, it will only be transferred to the next appointment if it hasn’t expired by that future date.
Emails
: We’ve got Jane practicing more gratitude! The customizable “Thanks for choosing us” text that was previously appearing for only
some
automated emails will now appear on
all
emails. Full Access users can edit this by heading to the Language section of your Settings and editing the “Phrases: Thanks For Choosing” message.
🇺🇸
ICD10 Code Set
: We did some early Spring cleaning of the ICD10 Code Set. 🧹 We’ve added any codes we missed in our last update and swept away any old, deprecated codes. While there might still be a few dust bunnies we’re working on, all active codes are now included in the code set.

Changelog: February 7th, 2022
🇨🇦 Sun Life Financial says goodbye to TELUS eClaims
Sun Life Financial claims are no longer accepted through TELUS eClaims as of
January 30th
.
This change means that all practice management vendors, like Jane, that are integrated with TELUS eClaims will no longer be able to direct bill to Sun Life. Instead, we’ll all have to use Sun Life’s stand-alone portal.
We’re easing this transition by updating your Sun Life (TELUS eClaims) insurers and their associated insurance policies from
integrated electronic submissions
to
portal billing,
as well as preventing any new Sun Life (TELUS eClaims) insurers from being created.
Improvements
Client List Report:
We added ‘
Referring Professional Phone Number’
to the exported version of this report! This is a nice little stepping stone along the path to making your Client List Report the most complete and useful it can be.
Keyboard Shortcuts:
They say there are no shortcuts in life, but there sure are in Jane! And we’ve just added 2 more. Hitting ‘
K
’ on your keyboard will now bring up your Task list and using ‘
Shift + ?
’ will pull up the full list of keyboard shortcuts that are available.
Choosing a Secure Password:
We’ve added a helpful resource to the Practitioner Profile setup to help you learn how to create a secure password.
🇬🇧
U.K. Insurance:
We’ve updated a few insurance terms to match the lingo used on your side of the pond.
🇺🇸
Staff Billing Settings:
We improved the design of the Staff Billing Settings by switching the
optional
Billing Settings from checkboxes to expandable chevrons. This should keep things feeling a little tidier as you scroll through.
Fixes
Insurance Info on Intake Forms:
Briefly, clients weren’t able to move past the Insurance Information step of an Intake Form if they had selected ‘Self’ as the Relationship to Insured
and
the Intake Form was set to require the Insured Person’s Details/Address. We’ve explained why that’s a touch illogical to Jane, and clients will once again be able to fill out their forms as expected.
Chart Items:
If you chart with multiple Body Charts, one after another, you may have noticed a bit of musical Body Charts going on when you upload a new image. We’ve told Jane there’s a time and place for dancing, and it’s not in your Chart Entries, so those should stay put from now on.
Intake Forms:
Folks were finding that some of their Intake Forms were rearranging themselves as well. We’ve fixed that up, and they should once again be appearing in the correct order.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: January 24th, 2022
Improvements
Locations
: We’ve added a drop-down menu to the Locations screen that will let you choose to view your
active
Locations or
archived
Locations. We also added a reminder there to save your changes while creating or editing a Location, because who doesn’t need a little nudge to save their work sometimes?
Welcome Emails
and
Password Reset Emails
: We’ve made an update to the links included in these emails to enhance the security of your Jane account. Now, once a client or colleague has clicked the link to update their password, the link will expire and they won’t be able to use it again.
Fixes
Sketch pad:
We found an issue where notes created on the sketch pad were being cut off when you went to download or print a Chart Entry. We’ve asked Jane to respect your masterpieces, so your sketch pad notes should remain intact from now on.
Intake Forms:
Client signatures were occasionally not appearing once a client had completed their Intake Form. We’ve fixed that up, and all forms that require signatures should display them moving forward.
Schedule:
A pesky little bug had us seeing double…
double-booking
, that is. An appointment would appear as if it had been double-booked when placed immediately after an existing appointment. We’ve asked that bug to step in line, and your Schedule should be back to normal.
Rooms
: We asked Jane to pump the breaks when someone tries to delete a room that has future appointments booked into it. This way, there’s no chance of someone’s Schedule getting messy if a Room is deleted before appointments are relocated.
🇨🇦
TELUS eClaims:
We found an issue where submissions for La Capitale and Coughlin & Associates were being rejected. We’ve patched that up, and you’ll be able to submit your claims without issue.
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: January 10th, 2022
Improvements
We added a friendly reminder to the
Treatment Settings
to Save your work before moving on. It’s a reminder we wish we had more often, so we figured that you might too!
We increased the number of characters you can use for your
Ratings and Reviews Google Prompt
from 255 to 500, so now you can customize to your heart’s content.
🇺🇸 We’ve improved our
ERA Management Tool!
Now, Jane will include any claim-level adjustments that might be included on a claim response, rather than just the individual billing code adjustments (which are the norm!).
Fixes
Clinic Locations
had become a bit stubborn about the order they were appearing in your Settings. We’ve reminded them who’s boss, and you can once again arrange them however you’d like.
For a while, Jane was allowing appointments to be reserved outside a shift when ‘
prevent staff booking outside of shifts
’ was turned on and the appointment was Copied and placed there. We did a bit of spackling, and Copied appointments won’t be slipping through the cracks anymore.
🇨🇦 The
“Check Eligibility”
button was appearing for all TELUS eClaims, even insurers that don’t actually accept them… whoops! We’ve patched that up, so now only claims under insurers that
do
in fact accept these submissions will show the option to do an eligibility check.
🔝

Changelog: December 20th, 2021
Memberships
We know a lot of you have been patiently waiting for this one (974, officially!), so we’re very happy to be able to say: you can now
create Memberships and collect recurring payments
in Jane!
Once you’ve created your Memberships, you can sell them to your clients to be billed on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis. If a client has a credit card on file, you can choose to have Jane charge them automatically. Other payment methods can be accepted manually. We’re hoping this feature will save you time and maybe even make you a little extra cash.
Improvements
We tweaked the way Jane creates an invoice to ensure that an
Insurer’s Legal Name
(instead of the Internal Name you’ve given it) is displayed.
Packages
will now be carried over when you Copy an appointment! This should save you a few extra clicks, especially if you’re booking several appointments out in advance.
For any clinics out there that have Staff members who practice
multiple disciplines
, we’ve asked Jane to clean up how and where those Staff appear on the main Schedule.
We made it a little easier to turn off
Ratings & Reviews
. While we’re always trying to make sure the i’s are dotted and t’s are crossed, we don’t want you to have to jump through hoops just to hit the off button.
We gave the
Need Help
section (in the top right corner of your Jane account) a complete makeover to make it even easier for you to get in touch whenever you need us.
Fixes
We discovered an issue where Jane was allowing
payments to be unapplied more than once.
This usually happened when you were trying to delete a big (like really big) payment and, while waiting for Jane to mull it over, perhaps hit that trash can button a few extra times. We’ve asked Jane to put a lid on the trash can while she’s thinking, so you shouldn’t run into this issue anymore.
A little bug was causing the
Treatments list
under a Staff member’s name on the Schedule to stay open even though the Staff member was deselected. We’ve swatted it away, and that list should once again tuck itself away when you don’t need to see it.
We’ve updated the Dashboard that appears in your Settings to factor in
Daylight Savings.
Turns out that time change was just as hard on Jane as it was on our sleep schedules. Go figure.
🔝

Changelog: December 6th, 2021
🇺🇸 Introducing CMS1500 support for Secondary Claims!
If you look at an appointment with two insurance policies added, you’ll now see an option in the Pay drop-down menu to generate a CMS1500 for the
Primary
or
Secondary
claim. This is
phase 1
of our plan to
support Secondary Claims in Jane
.
We’re now moving onto
phase 2
, which involves some adjustments to the Claim Submission folders to make it really easy to visualize and track Secondary Claims. After that, we’ll move onto
phase 3,
which will introduce support for
electronic submissions to secondaries
.
Intake Forms just got a little more organized
We’ve updated the way you can view and manage your patient’s Intake Forms from their patient profile! At-a-glance, you can see the name and status of their 5 most recent Intake Forms, and then you can click to expand the list if you’d like to view older forms (with unsubmitted at the top and submitted forms at the bottom).
When you click the three dots to the right of each Intake Form, you have the option to change the patient associated with the form or delete it altogether (as long as it hasn’t been signed; the account owner is still the only one who can delete a signed Intake Form).
Choose your favourite Chart Items and Templates
We had a lot of you requesting the ability to choose the Chart Items and Templates that appear in the dropdown menu under the
New Chart Entry
button, so this one is for all of you! You can now click the star next to your favourite Items and Templates to customize the options that appear in your dropdown menu. We hope this helps make your charting even easier and speedier!
📍
Update
(December 9th, 2021): After receiving some feedback from our community, we’ve decided to return to the previous design of the Chart Templates and Items area for now. We appreciate everyone who reached out with feedback, and we love working with you to make Jane the best it can be. If you’d like to contribute to our planning for how this area will change in the future, please
reach out to us
or add a
Feature Request
to our board.
Improvements
We’ve added the ability for you to hide your Location Address from appearing on your Online Booking site and patient email communication. Stealth mode engaged. 👀
We added Reflexology to the Discipline list found in Settings!
🇺🇸 Jane’s insurance billing got even more flexible last week, with the addition of a new setting to Staff Billing Settings:
Bill Under a Different Name or Rendering Provider?
This will make a few things easier: (1) working with students or new grads, (2) when you see a patient at the same time as another practitioner, or (3) if you need to bill under your full legal name, but use a different name with your patients.
🇺🇸 We added the Insurer Name to the list of details presented when linking an
Unlinked Claim Response
to its rightful claim. This will make it easier to find when Jane can’t link the claim response automatically, especially if a patient has a primary and secondary policy.
Fixes
We discovered an email translation that was showing up in some intimidating code speak. We promise the robots are not planning their uprising (quite yet), and the wording should be back to normal now. 🤖
We found and fixed an issue where
Clinical Surveys
were occasionally not being sent out.
When working with the Schedule, if
Copy or Move
had been selected, Jane was getting a bit stubborn about finishing that task before doing anything else. We’ve reminded Jane who the boss is, and you should once again be able to do other things as you go to Copy or Move an appointment.
We found a pesky issue where the
Ratings & Reviews settings
would sporadically reset. If you had any trouble with Review emails sending, we suggest double-checking to make sure they’re set up as you’d like them. We’ve made sure Jane won’t continue to misbehave.
🔝

Changelog: November 22, 2021
Insurer-Specific Modifiers
🇺🇸
This one is for our U.S. community: You can now set
insurer-specific modifiers
instead of having to add modifiers to every single appointment! From your Billing Settings, you can set up
default modifiers
for any insurers that need them. Less manual entry = fewer rejections (and hopefully fewer grey hairs as well)!
Improvements
You can now add a
New Patient
profile from the
Wait List
, the same way you can from the Appointment Panel. Go ahead and take a quick stretch break, because you just gained some time back in your day!
We’ve tweaked the
Ratings and Reviews Settings
page so that we don’t ask if you’d like to “
Select all treatments
” if you haven’t opted in any Staff members who offer those treatments.
We’ve made a little change to the
Pay Balance Email
to help you feel confident in the way you are asking your customers for money (it’s a difficult enough conversation as it is!). Now, you’ll be able to see a preview of what your client will see before you send it.
🇺🇸 When submitting insurance claims electronically, Jane now lets you know (and throws up a roadblock) if you’ve selected any secondary claims in your batch. Jane isn’t able to support electronic submission to secondary payers… yet! We’re working on a feature to allow for secondary submissions as we speak.
🇺🇸 We’ve added an option when creating a CPT code to include the description (label) in electronic and paper claim submissions. This unlocks the option for you to
bill Unlisted Services/Procedures
through Jane.
Fixes
We caught a bug that was nibbling on the Schedule: you’ll once again be able to select certain Staff to view using the
plus icon
while also filtering by discipline.
One of our favourite Chart Items,
the sketch pad
, was acting… well, a tiny bit
sketchy
… If you were using Safari, dots wouldn’t appear, but we’ve found the issue, and it’s once again behaving as expected.
We fixed an issue on the Schedule for anyone using Jane on mobile. The banner that prompts you to ‘
Tap and Hold
’ if you’d like to book an appointment was popping up and hanging around a little longer than expected. The banner will once again appear and disappear in a timely manner.
Some of the hyperlinks in the Patient Profile Notes area were redirecting users to, well, nowhere (like in Credit Memos and Packages). We’ve patched those up so we’re not sending you waywardly into the link abyss.
🔝

Changelog: November 8, 2021
Updates to Collecting Insurance Information on Intake Forms
As part of our mission to make insurance billing as smooth as possible in Jane, we’ve made another exciting update to our recently released
insurance information collection feature
. You’re now able to specify whether you want to collect the
primary policy holder’s
(ie. your client’s, or their spouse’s or parent’s)
personal details, address, or both: you let Jane know which details you’d like to collect, and Jane will provide the appropriate fields to do so. If your client selects anything other than ‘self’ for ‘Relationship to Insured’, new fields will appear to collect those details as well. This information will all automatically populate into your client’s insurance policies, awaiting your review.
Improvements
We tweaked the
Schedule
for
mobile devices
so you no longer have to tap twice in order to select a staff member.
If you were entering a
New Insurer Payment
from the
Insurer Invoices
area, you may have noticed that Jane was setting the default $ value to the
total amount
that was owed by that insurer. We like to be optimistic here at Jane, but that might be a bit too optimistic. We’ve told Jane to default the $ value to zero and let you enter what the insurer has actually paid.
We added some language translations to the
Ratings & Reviews
settings page.
🇺🇸 We added a
View Claim Response(s)
option in the Insurance Info section of the Appointment Panel and Purchases screen. Going forward, if a claim is connected to a claim response and you want to view or edit the EOB for the appointment, we recommend using this new option instead of ‘Edit EOB’ so you can see the remittance details.
🇨🇦 We hid
Alberta Blue Cross
as a TELUS eClaims insurer option for clinics in Alberta since only providers
outside of Alberta
are able to submit their Alberta Blue Cross claims through TELUS eClaims. Yep, we hear how that sounds! 🙃
Fixes
We caught a bug that was causing some of your Sketch Chart Entries to get a little cut-off.
When deleting Chart Entries from the Staff Profile, Jane was sending a
Not Found Error message
once the deed was done. But… you know, that was kind of the whole point of deleting it, so maybe a mission accomplished message would have been more accurate? We’ve removed the message altogether to help avoid any confusion in the future.
We brought back the camera icon for
Online Appointments
displayed in the Staff List. 📹
Jane was giving some users a little light sass when they tried to
delete a Patient Profile
that a File had been added to and then deleted from. Now, once all Files are deleted the Profile can be removed without any backtalk.
We’ve fixed an issue where, when copying and pasting something from Word into a Chart Entry, Jane was pasting the title of the Word document in there as well.
🇨🇦 In an attempt to help our clinics submit successful insurance claims, we may have made things a little
too
restrictive. 😳 We’ve loosened up a little, so if a claim is in a ‘no submission required’ state, you can once again edit billing and diagnosis codes. Go ahead, call us a helicopter practice management software, we deserve it.

Changelog: October 22nd, 2021
Update to Staff Social Media Logins
As part of our ongoing effort to protect the privacy and security of our clinics, we made a small change to
staff logins
. Staff members who exclusively
have a social media login
(Google, Facebook, Twitter) associated with their account
will now be prompted to create a standalone username and password
. This adds a layer of security to verify that it’s really you attempting to change sensitive information on your account. If you haven’t seen it already, we love
this webcomic
. It’s a great reminder that
strong
passwords don’t have to be hard to remember.
Improvements
We added a direct link to book a
New Account Set Up
call to the Onboarding Wizard for clinics that are still getting acquainted with Jane and could use a little help from our support team.
We made Jane
go a little faster when opening an appointment
from the schedule. This is a small performance step per appointment, but a giant leap for appointment-kind. 🌕
When working in
Patient Privacy Mode
(Shift+P) patient personal information will now also be obfuscated in the Reports area.
Instead of automatically arriving Online Appointments when a client arrives in the new
Waiting Room
, Jane now
lets you choose when to arrive the appointment
. Jane is helpful, but never bossy.
In true
you can’t change the past
fashion, you’ll now see a handy error message if you try updating an appointment on the schedule that has already been deleted.
Before deleting a claim that is linked to a remittance claim response, Jane now double checks if you
really
want to delete it. 🇺🇸
Fixes
After a brief break from being considered, rescheduled breaks are once again included in the
Hours Scheduled/Booked
Report.
We fixed an issue where Jane would sometimes display a different payment method other than the one you had just clicked on when processing a refund. In other words, we put the “fun” back in refund.
The instruction chart part was not following formatting instructions and would collapse
multipleparagraphstogether
. They should now be spaced out appropriately with an adequate amount of breathing room.
Some clinics reported an occasional hiccup when trying to load the
Insurer Invoices > Purchases
list under the Billing Tab. In true Halloween spirit, we put on a bedsheet with some cutout holes and successfully scared off those hiccups. 👻
Some things age well, like wine or one of those fancy cheeses. Others don’t age as gracefully… like insured appointments. While this only affected a handful of our most seasoned clinics, no one should experience trouble loading old insured appointments going forward. 🧀
Keyboard shortcuts
were not working from the Day sheet. Shortcuts are once again following their ⌘CMDs (commands— sorry Windows users, Apple joke) may once again hop to your schedule (Shift + 1) or double book (D key) with ease.
Accounts Owners who are also practitioners assigned to a Discipline will now be directed to the practitioner view when tapping the Schedule tab.
Folks were finding that they couldn’t copy or move appointments between the Day and Schedule Tabs. Appointments can now hop fluidly between views.
There was a small quirk that made filtering the electronic Remittances list challenging, especially if there were a large number of them in the folder. This should be much more manageable now. 🇺🇸
🔝
Skip back to top
Changelog: October 8th, 2021
Additional Profile Security
We have introduced an additional level of security to the profiles of staff members and patients that protects the information used to verify identity. All staff are now required to enter their password before updating their own — or another staff member’s — contact information. When a patient updates their own contact information via the
My Account
page, they will now have to enter their password before making changes.
ICD10 Code Set 2022 Update
🇺🇸
The ICD10 code set — which can be found in
Settings > Billing Codes
— has been updated to reflect
CMS’s 2022 changes
that took effect on October 1st. Valid diagnosis codes from 2021 that are now deprecated in the 2022 update have been removed from Jane’s ICD10 code set. Likewise, all replacement codes and new codes have been added. Learn more in our ICD10 FAQ
here
.
Improvements
We made some small tweaks to the styling of
Resources
on the schedule to improve things for clinics that use several Resources for appointment bookings.
We added a handy
guide
reference to help all new staff create a secure password when setting up their Jane account for the first time.
We added a new description to the Online Booking
post-treatment time
— which can be found in the Staff profile under
Edit/Settings > Online Booking
— to help practitioners better understand how to setup their schedule.
We made
Wait List
items update instantaneously when viewing the schedule. You can now see updates to the Wait List made by patients or other practitioners in real time! Sweet, sweet automation!
We made a small tweak to the drop-down options in the
Create a New Treatment
workflow. This change lays down the foundation for some exciting updates to Treatments that are coming down the line. Specifically, support for
Grouped Appointments
!
For our Canadian clinics, we have added TELUS eClaims support for
Alberta Blue Cross
. A friendly heads up that Alberta Blue Cross
only allows submissions via TELUS eClaims for those outside of Alberta
(we recognize that this sounds a bit strange!). 🇨🇦
For our Canadian clinics, Jane is now better equipped to handle situations where a bad or malformed response is received from
TELUS
or the insurer. This was previously causing pages (invoices, purchases, etc.) in Jane associated with the bad response to become inaccessible. Submissions with good and bad responses are now always accessible. 🇨🇦
Jane’s Polish Community - świętować!
Clinics in Poland
can now sign up for a
Jane Payments
(through Stripe) and start processing payments.  🇵🇱
We’ve added some missing
German translations
to receipts. Wunderbar! 🇩🇪
Fixes
Resending the right intake form
- Jane was sending
intake forms
for any expired forms, which caused some confusion. Now, Jane only resends the expired form if it’s required, or if your patient has an upcoming appointment.
The
Return Visit Reminder
(RVR) button wasn’t cooperating when accessed from the List View version of the Schedule after no-showing an appointment. It’s now cooperating and will direct you to the RVR form lickety-split when clicked.
We patched a hole that allowed
treatments on Wait List items
to be carried over when clinics changed the practitioner offering a different discipline.
Our
Ratings & Reviews
feature was accidentally blocking folks from selecting treatments assigned to a Discipline set to Not Bookable Online. We relaxed the rules here to ensure all treatments can be enabled for a Ratings email, regardless of the online booking policy.
The
“Reschedule an Appointment”
mode was triggered on mobile devices when scrolling on top of an appointment on the Schedule. Clinics can scroll easy knowing that they won’t accidentally move an appointment to another day.
The summary section of the
Applied & Unapplied (A&UP)
report was missing the first date of the selected date range in its calculations. The values should make sense now!
The
Onboarding Wizard
has undergone some improvements including a change that will allow users to freely navigate throughout Jane without the wizard popping in and out.
We noticed that some clinics were running into a blue sad-face error when
entering a very large price
for a product (over a hundred million dollars). Well, we’ve turned that frown upside down by adding a little message that gives you a heads up that you’ve probably entered the wrong price.
The price field was showing up blank on the
Edit Product form
for certain locales. Folks who use Euros as their currency should be able to see prices properly now when making changes to products. 🇬🇧

Insurance Card Photos can now be set to Optional
After receiving some great feedback from the community on our new
Insurance Information
Intake Form feature, we’ve introduced a preference that makes uploading an insurance card photo optional instead of required.
Customize the information you collect from New Clients
You can now tailor the
client sign up page
in our new
Settings > Client Form Fields
area to ensure you’re capturing the client information you need. This is also the place where you can enable
Pronoun
collection for your clients who book their appointments online.
Improvements
We’ve given the
Ratings and Review
set up page a new look to make it easier to navigate. We’d love to know what you think — send us a message if you have any thoughts!
We’ve prettied up the way
lists are formatted in chart entries
by removing some of the indentation.
We added a
sticky save bar in the Settings area
to remind you to save you changes before leaving.
We’ve introduced some
additional translations
for pronouns labels in Danish, German, English, Spanish, Estonian, French, Italian, Dutch, and Portuguese.
We also
updated some Danish language
for the Online Booking site. Shoutout to our newest Danish clinic for helping out with these translations!
Our team added a few
new videos
and helpful tips to improve the
onboarding
experience for new practitioners joining Jane for the first time.
Fixes
The
chart status icon
🔒 on the appointment in the day sheet was out of sync when changing / removing the linked appointment in a chart. I guess you could say the lock was not in lockstep but we got a lock on the issue, fastened a fix, and got the issue locked down.
Corrected our staff member defaults so that practitioners can see
breaks
on their schedule unless otherwise specified.
Administrative staff with Practitioner / Front Desk access can once again manage their own
shifts
. We see the irony in administrative staff not be able to administer their own shifts…
Fixed a bug that caused Jane to link
tasks
to the author rather than the assignee. Authors of Tasks can once again link tasks to other staff members, instead of only being able to assign them to themselves. You know what they say… when you want something done right, do it yourself…
We ensured clients who have a Jane account open in
multiple tabs on their browser
don’t run into issues when booking appointments online. Your clients can now go tab crazy and confidently book their appointments.
