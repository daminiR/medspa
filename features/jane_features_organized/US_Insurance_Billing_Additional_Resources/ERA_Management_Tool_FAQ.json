A\nremittance\nincludes a single payment amount - and parts of the payment amount are assigned to some but not necessarily all claims responses included in the remittance.\nA remittance usually has many claim responses.\nPaper Remittance\nIn short, a remittance that is external (i.e. a piece of paper). Some clearinghouses will use the term *Readable Remittance*. Paper remittances have to be recorded manually in Jane.\nSee the following guide for more info:\nPosting Insurer Payments for Paper Remittances\nElectronic Remittance (ERA)\nA remittance in the form of a 835 transaction. Basically one big text file that different systems - like Jane - can process to make it much easier for clinics to post payments.\nWhat is a Claim Response?\nA claim response is our Jane term for the adjudication and payment information for a\nsingle\nclaim. A\nremittance\nusually has many\nclaim responses\n.\nAll claim responses under a remittance show in a list when viewing a remittance:\nAnd when you View one of the claim responses, you’re brought to a page with the adjudication info for that claim (ERA details), as well as the Jane EOB screen:\nGeneral\nDoes this feature only work for particular clearinghouses?\nAlthough we only support electronic claim submissions to\nfour clearinghouses\n(Claim.MD, Office Ally, Availity & TriZetto), our ERA Management Tool will\nwork for remittances from any clearinghouse or insurer portal\n!\nCan I get my clearinghouse to automatically send ERAs to Jane?\nIf you’re using Claim.MD as your clearinghouse, yes! Check out our\nIntegrated Claims with Claim.MD beta\nto learn more.\nIf you’re working with another clearinghouse, you can manually upload ERAs to Jane.\nWhat is the Response Received folder? When does a claim move to Response Received?\nThe\nResponse Received\nfolder was introduced as part of our ERA Management Tool workflow.\nThis folder holds all of the claims that have been submitted and are linked to a claim responses that are still Awaiting Review. All the claims in this folder are waiting for your review - which can be done through the Remittances tab.\nA claim will move to\nResponse Received\nin two scenarios:\nIf you upload a remittance and Jane automatically links one of the claim responses in the remittance to that claim.\nIf you manually link a claim response to a claim on your account.\nOnce you apply the EOB/payment in the claim response, the claim will move out of the Response Received folder (i.e. if everything billed has been accounted for after the EOB, it’ll move to the Approved folder).\nWhere do I upload my ERAs?\nIn the\nRemittances folder\n, which can be found in the\nBilling tab\n.\nWhat does Unlinked mean, and why is my claim response Unlinked?\nA claim response will start as\nUnlinked\nif\nJane isn’t able to automatically link it to a claim\non your account. This usually only happens if you didn’t submit the claim through Jane!\nIf you’re working with an Unlinked claim response, you can manually link it to a claim on your account by using the search bar in the claim response view. You can use the details found at the top of the claim response to help determine which claim to link!\nIf you accidentally link a claim response to the wrong claim, you\nunlink\nit by clicking the broken chainlink icon.\nHow can I add different insurer payment methods on the remittance screen?\nTo view and update the list of payment methods that appears on the remittance screen, a staff member with\nFull Access\ncan head over to the\nSettings\ntab and click on\nPayment Methods\nwithin the left sidebar menu. Next, you’ll want to click on the blue\nNew\nbutton.\nFor more step-by-step instructions on this process, check out our\nCreating a New Payment Method\nguide.\nUploading an ERA\nWhat happens if we upload an ERA file we have already manually reconciled in Jane?\nYou have two choices!\nFirst choice\n: If you’ve already manually posted the entire payment, then you can simply delete the ERA file you’ve uploaded!\nSecond choice\n: If you’ve manually processed EOBs under claims for some but not all claim responses in the remittance, then you can use the ERA workflow to process the remaining EOBs, and manually mark the redundant claim responses as ‘Reviewed’.\nManually marking a claim response as ‘Reviewed’\ndoes not apply an EOB or payment\nto the linked claim - it just tells Jane you’re done with that claim response. Since you’ve already applied an EOB and payment to the claim, there’s no need to apply another EOB through the claim response!\nWhat happens if we upload an ERA that includes claims responses from multiple insurers?\nSometimes you might be managing the same insurance company as two different insurers in Jane. Or, a big insurance company might have multiple entities that you submit claims to, but just a single place where money is sent from, which causes you to create multiple insurers for each submission entity.\nIn both of these cases, Jane has you covered.\nIf you upload a remittance with claim responses that are automatically linked to claims from\nmultiple insurers\nin your Jane account, then Jane will ask which insurer you’d like to record the overall payment under in step 1. You’ll be able to apply the payment to all claims in the remittance, so just choose the insurer you’d like to have the payment under for your records.\nWhat types of ERA files are not supported?\nElectronic remittances can come in a ton of different file extensions. Oddly enough, every clearinghouse tends to have a different default ERA file extension. But that’s okay, because Jane supports many different files extensions.\nThe only file types we don’t support are PDF, ZIP, and Spreadsheets (CSV or XLSX). Electronic remittances typically don’t come in any of these file types anyways, and your clearinghouse will definitely have a different file option.\nCan I delete a remittance?\nYes\n- but only if all the claim responses in the remittance are still Awaiting Review.\nIf you’ve uploaded an ERA, and realize afterwards that you’ve already posted that payment manually as a paper remittance, then you can select that remittance in the Remittances list, click the Selected dropdown, and choose the Delete button.\nNote that you can\nonly delete remittances that are Awaiting Review or Unlinked\n. You can’t delete remittances if they are In Progress or Approved (since that means you’ve posted some or all of the payment)!\nGetting Specific\nHow do I manage claim reversals/reversals of previous payments?\nTo fully answer this question, we need to really dive deep into an example. But before we do that, here’s the\nTL:DR\nof how to manage a claim reversal:\nIf the insurer is changing how they originally adjudicated a claim, then you should get\ntwo\nnew claim responses in the remittance:\na claim response that reverses the previous claim/payment (\nReversal\n). This claim response typically includes all negative amounts to reverse the previous allowed, paid, and patient amounts!\na claim response that states the new\ntotal\nadjudication amounts of the claim. “Total” meaning if an insurer paid you $20 originally, and then decides that they will actually be paying you $30, the new total amount on the claim response would be $30.\nTo manage these new claims responses, you’ll want to:\nManually mark the reversal claim response as Reviewed (do not apply an EOB in this claim response - just acknowledge that you’ve seen it!).\nFollow the typical “additional EOB” workflow for the new claim response. Applying the EOB for the adjusted amounts will apply any additional insurer payment in this remittance, or it will create a credit for previous insurer payment(s) depending on if the insurer is sending more money or telling you they paid you too much before.\nOkay, let’s walk through an example together in the following video tutorial. In this example, the insurer did not pay us the first time we submitted the claim because we forgot some key information. However, after we re-billed the claim, they paid!\nManaging Claim Reversals/Reversals of Previous Payments\nWhat happens if I get a claim response for a claim that has a previously entered EOB?\nFirst off, when we say “claim that has a previously entered EOB”, we mean that you’ve already applied an EOB to that claim in Jane. In other words, a claim that has already had at least one response from the insurer.\nWhen you view a claim response that is linked to a claim that has a previously recorded EOB, the new claim response will still start in Awaiting Review (just like all other claim responses!). Because an EOB has already been applied to this claim, Jane will not automatically pre-fill the EOB screen with the new response values when viewing the new claim response.\nInstead, you will see the “additional EOB” screen; Where the totals from the previously entered EOB are displayed, and are greyed out.\nJane doesn’t pre-fill the EOB screen with the values from the new claim response so you don’t lose any previous EOB information!\nThat said, you still can make adjustments to the previously entered EOB when reviewing the new claim response - you’ll just need to\nmake these changes manually.\nHere are some examples of when you’d likely need to adjust the previous EOB to reflect the newest response from the insurer:\nyou received more money from insurance\nthe insurer is recovering an overpayment from the previous response\nthe patient responsibility has changed\nIf you need to update the EOB, then you can click\nEdit Existing Amounts\nbutton for each procedure that requires a change.\nWhen you press that button, you’ll be able to adjust any of the procedures values as needed. Once you’ve updated all your procedures, hit\nApply Changes\nand you’re done reviewing the claim response!\nMore on the\nrecording additional insurer payments\ncan be found\nhere\n**\nWhat if the insurer states a portion of the visit is the patient’s responsibility, but it isn’t a copay, coinsurance, or deductible?\nJane has you covered!\nHow are Claim Responses organized/filtered by default in a given remittance?\nJane groups related claim responses together! If there is more than one claim response for the same claim (i.e. if there is a claim reversal), then they will be next to each other in the list.\nWhat happens if a claim response is linked to the incorrect date of service in the ERA?\nJane has some checks and safeguards in place to link a claim response in an ERA to the correct claim, including parameters like:\nChecking for a match in the patient’s name\nChecking for a match in the date of service\nChecking for a match in the Claim Submitter’s ID (the unique ID associated with the claim batch it was submitted with)\nHowever, if a claim response is linked to the incorrect claim, you will be able to Unlink it from the claim using the Unlink button when viewing the claim response:\nWhen a claim response is unlinked, you can search for and find the appropriate claim and click\nLink\n:\nHow can I change the payer of an ERA that I have received?\nJane will do some checks to confirm with the payer that the ERA matches the insurers that you have set up in your account.\nIf there is a situation where it isn’t clear from the ERA who the payer is, in\nStep 1: Payment Informatio\nn, the Payer field will be a dropdown where you can specify the insurer who has sent this payment:\nIf in this first step, you indicate the incorrect insurer using the dropdown, you can\nSelect\nthe remittance, then by clicking Selected (1) you can\nDelete\nthat ERA. From here, you can upload it again.\n💡\nPro Tip\n: When posting remittances from an ERA, you can actually apply the claim responses to claims from other payers. This can be helpful if you receive a payment from an insurer that processes and pays out claims on behalf of another insurer.\nWhat is a Provider Adjustment? What is an Overpayment Recovery?\nWhen an insurer processes a claim, they typically make adjustments to each procedure. Adjustments made to procedures are commonly referred to as\nservice adjustments\n. Each service adjustment is accompanied by a dollar amount and a reason code. Adjustments essentially explain why an insurer isn’t reimbursing you for the full amount that you billed. The most common examples of service level adjustments are related to contractual obligations (i.e. CO:45 — billing more than your contracted rate), and patient responsiblity (i.e. PO:1 — which means the amount is going towards the patient’s deductible).\nIn addition to service adjustments, insurers will occasionally adjust the total payment amount of a remittance to account for a reason that’s unrelated to any of the claims or procedures in the remittance. Adjustments made to the entire remittance (not made to one specific claim or procedure) are called\nprovider adjustments\n.\nIf a remittance has provider adjustments, Jane will display them in the top right hand corner of the remittance view. You’ll see the type of adjustment, the amount (positive or negative), and the reference number the insurer has assigned to it. If you have any questions or concerns about a particular provider adjustment, it can be helpful to use that reference number when following up with the insurer.\nHere are some common examples of provider adjustments that you might see on your remittances:\n50: Late Charge (late claim filing penalty)\n51: Interest Penalty Charge (interest assessment for late claim filing)\nIP: Incentive Premium Payment (one of the few positive Provider Adjustments you can receive)\nWO: Overpayment Recovery\n(the recovery of an overpayment from a previous remittance)\nThe most common — and most difficult to reconcile — provider adjustments are\nOverpayment Recoveries\n. Overpayment Recoveries occur when an insurer reviews their previous payment records and finds that they paid you too much for some previously adjudicated claims — claims that have likely been sitting as Paid and Approved in your Jane account for quite some time.\nWhen an insurer identifies an overpayment, they will send you a notice that explains the overpayment amount (i.e. why you should have been paid less, which claims were overpaid etc). The notice will state the recovery amount, and will give the option to either return the money (i.e. write them a check), or if you do nothing, have them take the amount out of a future remittance.\nLike most clinics, you’ll most likely choose the latter (although you could make things easier on your bookkeeper by taking the former option).\nIf you choose the latter, then you’ll eventually receive a remittance with an overpayment provider adjustment that reduces the total amount of the payment.\nFor example, let’s say that your remittance includes responses for 5 claims, and sum of the paid amounts for all 5 claims in $500. If the insurer previously overpaid you by $100 in a payment from 2 months ago, then you’ll only receive a payment of $400 with this remittance.\nSo, when you review your last couple responses, you won’t have the available funds (the remaining $100) to apply. The remaining funds that you need are from the previous overpayment in your account — a payment you likely recorded and applied months ago! The insurer is basically saying “apply the $100 we accidentally sent you months ago — money that’s probably applied to another patient’s claim at the moment —  to pay for the remaining claims in this remittance”.\nTo find that $100, you’re going to have to reference the notice the insurer originally sent you, because the new ERA (with the Provider Adjustment) doesn’t tell you which claims were previously overpaid.\nOnce you find that $100, you’ll need to manually apply it to the remaining claim responses.\nHow do I enable Integrated Claims with Claim.MD?\nIn your Claim.MD account\nBefore connecting your Claim.MD account with Jane, you’ll need to log in to Claim.MD and adjust a couple of settings. Choose Settings from the list on the left and then click the Account Settings tab at the top of the page.\nStart by setting the SFTP Active field to Yes.\n📣 While on this screen, note down your SFTP Username and Password. The password is only visible once in Claim.MD, so be sure to note down your password before leaving this page.\nSome other key settings to check:\n•\nClaim Status Format\nshould be\n277\n•\nReceive ERA/835\nshould be\n835\n•\nTransmit Approval Required\nshould be\nunchecked\n(if it’s on, you’ll have to log in to Claim.MD to approve all claims submitted through the integration)\nThese settings will ensure that Jane automatically sends claims to Claim.MD and that Claim.MD automatically sends claim acknowledgements (like Rejections) and ERAs back to Jane.\n**In your Jane account\n**\nNow that you have your Claim.MD SFTP username and password, you can connect your Claim.MD account with Jane in\nSettings > Integrations > Clearinghouse.\nNext, enter your Claim.MD SFTP username and SFTP password — the username and password that you noted down when enabling SFTP in your Claim.MD account.\nNote that your SFTP login credentials are different than the username and password you use to login to your Claim.MD account.\nAnd that’s all! You’re ready to start billing through Integrated Claims with Claim.MD!\nHow do I download ERAs from Office Ally?\nFor full instructions on how to download ERAs, check out\nOffice Ally’s ERA User Manual\nClick on Download\nEOB/ERA 835\n.\nSelect a date on the calendar.Pink dates are days that have pending ERAs.\nClick the View link in the Download/View column next to the ERA file you wish to download. This will download the\nzip file which contains both the\nactual 835 file\nand a readable text version (txt) of the ERA.\nYou’ll need to upload the 835 file to Jane. Jane can’t process the readable text version!\nOffice Ally gave me two remittance files. Which one should I upload to Jane?\nDownload the 835 file. The txt file is the paper remittance.\nHow do I download ERAs from Availity?\nHead into your\nClaims & Payments\nfolder, and select the\nRemittance Viewer\n. You’ll be able to download remittances on the next screen!\nIf you are having trouble locating your ERA’s in the correct format, you may need to enroll first. Below are some steps to walk you through the enrollment process.\nYou can start the enrollment for ERAs/EFTs by navigating to\nMy Providers > Enrollment Center > Transaction Enrollment.\nFrom here, select\nEnroll > Enroll a Provider.\nIf you would like your ERAs to be forwarded to another Clearinghouse besides Availity, make sure to check the box after selecting your Organization that states\n“Forward ERA files to another Clearinghouse”\nThe ERA files will now be delivered to your FTP mailbox located under\nClaims & Payments > Send/Receive EDI Files > Receive Files.\nHow do I download ERAs from TriZetto?\nYou can download new remittances in a folder in your account call\nRemits\n!.\nWe’re sorry this is so short! The TriZetto team doesn’t have any public resources available for downloading ERAs from their system that we can share here. They recommend that you go to the Resources tab in your account, and click Help Videos or Online Help. Both of these options have ERA-related content.\nHow do I download ERAs from Claim.MD?\nSelect\nView ERA\nwhich can be found under the Claim Menu. Next, select all the ERAs you haven’t processed yet (you can select multiple in one go!). The last step is click the Select Action dropdown, and choose the Download Selected 835 option.\nHow do I download ERAs from Waystar?\nAlthough we don’t explicitly support electronic claim submissions to Waystar, some Jane clinics continue to successfully use it for their insurance billing needs.\nHere’s how you can download a remittance from Waystar:\nHead to your Remits tab and click Payments.\nChoose your remit, click the dropdown arrow, and select Download.\nA new Downloads screen will appear. You’ll want to click Go To Downloads.\nLastly, head to the Downloads area in the Remits tab, and click the dropdown beside the remittance. This will download the ERA onto your device!\nHow do I upload an ERA from Claim.MD that wasn’t submitted through Jane?\nIn general, claims should be automatically syncing with Jane and if this is not the case, the recommendation here is to take a peek at your settings in Claim.MD.\nTo get started,, log into your Claim.MD account and head over to the\nSettings\ntab and then click on\nAccount Settings\n.\nFrom there, scroll down to the\nSFTP Settings\nsection and set the\nReceive ERA/835\nfield to\n*835\n.\nThis setting will make sure your ERAs are in the correct format so that they’re able to automatically drop into your Remittances folder in your Jane account.\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter.\nWelcome\nWelcome to the Jane Guide\nCode of Conduct\nFeature Requests\nJane's Brand Assets\nAccount Setup Consultations\nWhat's new in Jane?\nWhat's new in Jane Webinar\nJane's Changelog\nJane's Monthly Newsletter\nUpdates to Interchange Fees for Visa & Mastercard in Canada 🇨🇦\nHoward Spector joins Jane!\nJane Appoints Dan Davidow as Chief Marketing Officer\nJane App's Support Team Wins a Bronze Stevie® Award\nDemo Videos\nPractitioner's Home Base: Day Sheets & Charts\nJane in Action\nPractitioner Training:  Initial Signing In and Overview\nInsurance: Billing a Visit to a 3rd Party\nScheduling: Managing the Schedule with Many Practitioners\nDisciplines, Treatments, & Billing Settings\nSetting up Staff & Scheduling Shifts\nCharting: Signing, Duplicating & Symbols\nScheduling: Complete Schedule Overview\nBilling: Accepting Payments\nLaunching an Insurer Portal\nQuick Start\nStep 1: Clinic Information\nStep 2: Disciplines\nStep 3: Treatments\nStep 4: Staff\nStep 5: Schedule or Diary\nAdditional Set Up Recommendations\nPractitioner Step 1: Practitioner Training\nPractitioner Step 2: Treatments\nPractitioner Step 3: Shifts\nPractitioner Step 4: Online Booking\nPractitioner Step 5: Charting\nAccount Setup Consultations\nSwitching to Jane\nSwitching is easy with Jane on your team\nJane vs. SimplePractice\nAccount Basics\nHow To Check Who's Listed As Account Owner\nChecklist for Starting with Jane\nBrowser Requirements\nDevice & Network Recommendations\nUsing Jane on a Tablet\nUsing Jane on a Smartphone\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nAuto-Logout Duration\nUpdating Your Clinic Email Address & Phone Number\nLog In Help: Username and Password\nEnabling Patient Self Check-in\nAdding a Location\nBooking  a Break on a Mobile Device (Phone or other Small Screen)\nMoving Your Practice to a New Location\nMultiple Locations or Multiple Accounts: How to Set Up Jane for Independent Locations or Practitioners\nAccessibility in Jane\nI Can't Access My Jane Account: A Troubleshooting Guide\nHow to Archive a Treatment, Class or Group Appointment\nBookmarking Your Jane Account for Easy Access\nViewing Protected Financial Documents (For Patients)\nSwitching to the Balance Plan\nAdding a Billing Address for Locations\nUnauthorized Access: What to Do if Your Laptop/Phone is Lost or Stolen\nHow to Archive/Unarchive a Discipline\nHow to Change the Name of Your Clinic\nImporting to Jane\nHow to Import Data to Jane (Overview)\nBasics of Importing to Jane\nDiving Deeper Into Importing to Jane\nWhere Can You Import From?

If so, you’re in the right place!\nTerms\nWhat is a Remittance?\nWhat is a Claim Response?\nGeneral\nDoes this feature only work for particular clearinghouses?\nCan I get my clearinghouse to automatically send ERAs to Jane?\nWhat is the Response Received folder? When does a claim move to Response Received?\nWhere do I upload my ERAs?\nWhat does Unlinked mean, and why is my claim response Unlinked?\nHow can I add different insurer payment methods on the remittance screen?\nUploading an ERA\nWhat happens if we upload an ERA file we have already manually reconciled in Jane?\nWhat happens if we upload an ERA that includes claims responses from multiple insurers?\nWhat types of ERA files are not supported?\nCan I delete a remittance?\nGetting Specific\nHow do I manage claim reversals/reversals of previous payments?\nWhat happens if I get a claim response for a claim that has a previously entered EOB?\nWhat if the insurer states a portion of the visit is the patient’s responsibility, but it isn’t a copay, coinsurance, or deductible?\nHow are Claim Responses organized/filtered by default in a given remittance?\nWhat happens if a claim response is linked to the incorrect date of service in the ERA?\nHow can I change the payer of an ERA I received?\nWhat is a Provider Level Adjustment?

A\nremittance\nincludes a single payment amount - and parts of the payment amount are assigned to some but not necessarily all claims responses included in the remittance.\nA remittance usually has many claim responses.\nPaper Remittance\nIn short, a remittance that is external (i.e. a piece of paper). Some clearinghouses will use the term *Readable Remittance*. Paper remittances have to be recorded manually in Jane.\nSee the following guide for more info:\nPosting Insurer Payments for Paper Remittances\nElectronic Remittance (ERA)\nA remittance in the form of a 835 transaction. Basically one big text file that different systems - like Jane - can process to make it much easier for clinics to post payments.\nWhat is a Claim Response?\nA claim response is our Jane term for the adjudication and payment information for a\nsingle\nclaim. A\nremittance\nusually has many\nclaim responses\n.\nAll claim responses under a remittance show in a list when viewing a remittance:\nAnd when you View one of the claim responses, you’re brought to a page with the adjudication info for that claim (ERA details), as well as the Jane EOB screen:\nGeneral\nDoes this feature only work for particular clearinghouses?\nAlthough we only support electronic claim submissions to\nfour clearinghouses\n(Claim.MD, Office Ally, Availity & TriZetto), our ERA Management Tool will\nwork for remittances from any clearinghouse or insurer portal\n!\nCan I get my clearinghouse to automatically send ERAs to Jane?\nIf you’re using Claim.MD as your clearinghouse, yes! Check out our\nIntegrated Claims with Claim.MD beta\nto learn more.\nIf you’re working with another clearinghouse, you can manually upload ERAs to Jane.\nWhat is the Response Received folder? When does a claim move to Response Received?\nThe\nResponse Received\nfolder was introduced as part of our ERA Management Tool workflow.\nThis folder holds all of the claims that have been submitted and are linked to a claim responses that are still Awaiting Review. All the claims in this folder are waiting for your review - which can be done through the Remittances tab.\nA claim will move to\nResponse Received\nin two scenarios:\nIf you upload a remittance and Jane automatically links one of the claim responses in the remittance to that claim.\nIf you manually link a claim response to a claim on your account.\nOnce you apply the EOB/payment in the claim response, the claim will move out of the Response Received folder (i.e. if everything billed has been accounted for after the EOB, it’ll move to the Approved folder).\nWhere do I upload my ERAs?\nIn the\nRemittances folder\n, which can be found in the\nBilling tab\n.\nWhat does Unlinked mean, and why is my claim response Unlinked?\nA claim response will start as\nUnlinked\nif\nJane isn’t able to automatically link it to a claim\non your account. This usually only happens if you didn’t submit the claim through Jane!\nIf you’re working with an Unlinked claim response, you can manually link it to a claim on your account by using the search bar in the claim response view. You can use the details found at the top of the claim response to help determine which claim to link!\nIf you accidentally link a claim response to the wrong claim, you\nunlink\nit by clicking the broken chainlink icon.\nHow can I add different insurer payment methods on the remittance screen?\nTo view and update the list of payment methods that appears on the remittance screen, a staff member with\nFull Access\ncan head over to the\nSettings\ntab and click on\nPayment Methods\nwithin the left sidebar menu. Next, you’ll want to click on the blue\nNew\nbutton.\nFor more step-by-step instructions on this process, check out our\nCreating a New Payment Method\nguide.\nUploading an ERA\nWhat happens if we upload an ERA file we have already manually reconciled in Jane?\nYou have two choices!\nFirst choice\n: If you’ve already manually posted the entire payment, then you can simply delete the ERA file you’ve uploaded!\nSecond choice\n: If you’ve manually processed EOBs under claims for some but not all claim responses in the remittance, then you can use the ERA workflow to process the remaining EOBs, and manually mark the redundant claim responses as ‘Reviewed’.\nManually marking a claim response as ‘Reviewed’\ndoes not apply an EOB or payment\nto the linked claim - it just tells Jane you’re done with that claim response. Since you’ve already applied an EOB and payment to the claim, there’s no need to apply another EOB through the claim response!\nWhat happens if we upload an ERA that includes claims responses from multiple insurers?\nSometimes you might be managing the same insurance company as two different insurers in Jane. Or, a big insurance company might have multiple entities that you submit claims to, but just a single place where money is sent from, which causes you to create multiple insurers for each submission entity.\nIn both of these cases, Jane has you covered.\nIf you upload a remittance with claim responses that are automatically linked to claims from\nmultiple insurers\nin your Jane account, then Jane will ask which insurer you’d like to record the overall payment under in step 1. You’ll be able to apply the payment to all claims in the remittance, so just choose the insurer you’d like to have the payment under for your records.\nWhat types of ERA files are not supported?\nElectronic remittances can come in a ton of different file extensions. Oddly enough, every clearinghouse tends to have a different default ERA file extension. But that’s okay, because Jane supports many different files extensions.\nThe only file types we don’t support are PDF, ZIP, and Spreadsheets (CSV or XLSX). Electronic remittances typically don’t come in any of these file types anyways, and your clearinghouse will definitely have a different file option.\nCan I delete a remittance?\nYes\n- but only if all the claim responses in the remittance are still Awaiting Review.\nIf you’ve uploaded an ERA, and realize afterwards that you’ve already posted that payment manually as a paper remittance, then you can select that remittance in the Remittances list, click the Selected dropdown, and choose the Delete button.\nNote that you can\nonly delete remittances that are Awaiting Review or Unlinked\n. You can’t delete remittances if they are In Progress or Approved (since that means you’ve posted some or all of the payment)!\nGetting Specific\nHow do I manage claim reversals/reversals of previous payments?\nTo fully answer this question, we need to really dive deep into an example. But before we do that, here’s the\nTL:DR\nof how to manage a claim reversal:\nIf the insurer is changing how they originally adjudicated a claim, then you should get\ntwo\nnew claim responses in the remittance:\na claim response that reverses the previous claim/payment (\nReversal\n). This claim response typically includes all negative amounts to reverse the previous allowed, paid, and patient amounts!\na claim response that states the new\ntotal\nadjudication amounts of the claim. “Total” meaning if an insurer paid you $20 originally, and then decides that they will actually be paying you $30, the new total amount on the claim response would be $30.\nTo manage these new claims responses, you’ll want to:\nManually mark the reversal claim response as Reviewed (do not apply an EOB in this claim response - just acknowledge that you’ve seen it!).\nFollow the typical “additional EOB” workflow for the new claim response. Applying the EOB for the adjusted amounts will apply any additional insurer payment in this remittance, or it will create a credit for previous insurer payment(s) depending on if the insurer is sending more money or telling you they paid you too much before.\nOkay, let’s walk through an example together in the following video tutorial. In this example, the insurer did not pay us the first time we submitted the claim because we forgot some key information. However, after we re-billed the claim, they paid!\nManaging Claim Reversals/Reversals of Previous Payments\nWhat happens if I get a claim response for a claim that has a previously entered EOB?\nFirst off, when we say “claim that has a previously entered EOB”, we mean that you’ve already applied an EOB to that claim in Jane. In other words, a claim that has already had at least one response from the insurer.\nWhen you view a claim response that is linked to a claim that has a previously recorded EOB, the new claim response will still start in Awaiting Review (just like all other claim responses!). Because an EOB has already been applied to this claim, Jane will not automatically pre-fill the EOB screen with the new response values when viewing the new claim response.\nInstead, you will see the “additional EOB” screen; Where the totals from the previously entered EOB are displayed, and are greyed out.\nJane doesn’t pre-fill the EOB screen with the values from the new claim response so you don’t lose any previous EOB information!\nThat said, you still can make adjustments to the previously entered EOB when reviewing the new claim response - you’ll just need to\nmake these changes manually.\nHere are some examples of when you’d likely need to adjust the previous EOB to reflect the newest response from the insurer:\nyou received more money from insurance\nthe insurer is recovering an overpayment from the previous response\nthe patient responsibility has changed\nIf you need to update the EOB, then you can click\nEdit Existing Amounts\nbutton for each procedure that requires a change.\nWhen you press that button, you’ll be able to adjust any of the procedures values as needed. Once you’ve updated all your procedures, hit\nApply Changes\nand you’re done reviewing the claim response!\nMore on the\nrecording additional insurer payments\ncan be found\nhere\n**\nWhat if the insurer states a portion of the visit is the patient’s responsibility, but it isn’t a copay, coinsurance, or deductible?\nJane has you covered!\nHow are Claim Responses organized/filtered by default in a given remittance?\nJane groups related claim responses together! If there is more than one claim response for the same claim (i.e. if there is a claim reversal), then they will be next to each other in the list.\nWhat happens if a claim response is linked to the incorrect date of service in the ERA?\nJane has some checks and safeguards in place to link a claim response in an ERA to the correct claim, including parameters like:\nChecking for a match in the patient’s name\nChecking for a match in the date of service\nChecking for a match in the Claim Submitter’s ID (the unique ID associated with the claim batch it was submitted with)\nHowever, if a claim response is linked to the incorrect claim, you will be able to Unlink it from the claim using the Unlink button when viewing the claim response:\nWhen a claim response is unlinked, you can search for and find the appropriate claim and click\nLink\n:\nHow can I change the payer of an ERA that I have received?\nJane will do some checks to confirm with the payer that the ERA matches the insurers that you have set up in your account.\nIf there is a situation where it isn’t clear from the ERA who the payer is, in\nStep 1: Payment Informatio\nn, the Payer field will be a dropdown where you can specify the insurer who has sent this payment:\nIf in this first step, you indicate the incorrect insurer using the dropdown, you can\nSelect\nthe remittance, then by clicking Selected (1) you can\nDelete\nthat ERA. From here, you can upload it again.\n💡\nPro Tip\n: When posting remittances from an ERA, you can actually apply the claim responses to claims from other payers. This can be helpful if you receive a payment from an insurer that processes and pays out claims on behalf of another insurer.\nWhat is a Provider Adjustment? What is an Overpayment Recovery?\nWhen an insurer processes a claim, they typically make adjustments to each procedure. Adjustments made to procedures are commonly referred to as\nservice adjustments\n. Each service adjustment is accompanied by a dollar amount and a reason code. Adjustments essentially explain why an insurer isn’t reimbursing you for the full amount that you billed. The most common examples of service level adjustments are related to contractual obligations (i.e. CO:45 — billing more than your contracted rate), and patient responsiblity (i.e. PO:1 — which means the amount is going towards the patient’s deductible).\nIn addition to service adjustments, insurers will occasionally adjust the total payment amount of a remittance to account for a reason that’s unrelated to any of the claims or procedures in the remittance. Adjustments made to the entire remittance (not made to one specific claim or procedure) are called\nprovider adjustments\n.\nIf a remittance has provider adjustments, Jane will display them in the top right hand corner of the remittance view. You’ll see the type of adjustment, the amount (positive or negative), and the reference number the insurer has assigned to it. If you have any questions or concerns about a particular provider adjustment, it can be helpful to use that reference number when following up with the insurer.\nHere are some common examples of provider adjustments that you might see on your remittances:\n50: Late Charge (late claim filing penalty)\n51: Interest Penalty Charge (interest assessment for late claim filing)\nIP: Incentive Premium Payment (one of the few positive Provider Adjustments you can receive)\nWO: Overpayment Recovery\n(the recovery of an overpayment from a previous remittance)\nThe most common — and most difficult to reconcile — provider adjustments are\nOverpayment Recoveries\n. Overpayment Recoveries occur when an insurer reviews their previous payment records and finds that they paid you too much for some previously adjudicated claims — claims that have likely been sitting as Paid and Approved in your Jane account for quite some time.\nWhen an insurer identifies an overpayment, they will send you a notice that explains the overpayment amount (i.e. why you should have been paid less, which claims were overpaid etc). The notice will state the recovery amount, and will give the option to either return the money (i.e. write them a check), or if you do nothing, have them take the amount out of a future remittance.\nLike most clinics, you’ll most likely choose the latter (although you could make things easier on your bookkeeper by taking the former option).\nIf you choose the latter, then you’ll eventually receive a remittance with an overpayment provider adjustment that reduces the total amount of the payment.\nFor example, let’s say that your remittance includes responses for 5 claims, and sum of the paid amounts for all 5 claims in $500. If the insurer previously overpaid you by $100 in a payment from 2 months ago, then you’ll only receive a payment of $400 with this remittance.\nSo, when you review your last couple responses, you won’t have the available funds (the remaining $100) to apply. The remaining funds that you need are from the previous overpayment in your account — a payment you likely recorded and applied months ago! The insurer is basically saying “apply the $100 we accidentally sent you months ago — money that’s probably applied to another patient’s claim at the moment —  to pay for the remaining claims in this remittance”.\nTo find that $100, you’re going to have to reference the notice the insurer originally sent you, because the new ERA (with the Provider Adjustment) doesn’t tell you which claims were previously overpaid.\nOnce you find that $100, you’ll need to manually apply it to the remaining claim responses.\nHow do I enable Integrated Claims with Claim.MD?\nIn your Claim.MD account\nBefore connecting your Claim.MD account with Jane, you’ll need to log in to Claim.MD and adjust a couple of settings. Choose Settings from the list on the left and then click the Account Settings tab at the top of the page.\nStart by setting the SFTP Active field to Yes.\n📣 While on this screen, note down your SFTP Username and Password. The password is only visible once in Claim.MD, so be sure to note down your password before leaving this page.\nSome other key settings to check:\n•\nClaim Status Format\nshould be\n277\n•\nReceive ERA/835\nshould be\n835\n•\nTransmit Approval Required\nshould be\nunchecked\n(if it’s on, you’ll have to log in to Claim.MD to approve all claims submitted through the integration)\nThese settings will ensure that Jane automatically sends claims to Claim.MD and that Claim.MD automatically sends claim acknowledgements (like Rejections) and ERAs back to Jane.\n**In your Jane account\n**\nNow that you have your Claim.MD SFTP username and password, you can connect your Claim.MD account with Jane in\nSettings > Integrations > Clearinghouse.\nNext, enter your Claim.MD SFTP username and SFTP password — the username and password that you noted down when enabling SFTP in your Claim.MD account.\nNote that your SFTP login credentials are different than the username and password you use to login to your Claim.MD account.\nAnd that’s all! You’re ready to start billing through Integrated Claims with Claim.MD!\nHow do I download ERAs from Office Ally?\nFor full instructions on how to download ERAs, check out\nOffice Ally’s ERA User Manual\nClick on Download\nEOB/ERA 835\n.\nSelect a date on the calendar.Pink dates are days that have pending ERAs.\nClick the View link in the Download/View column next to the ERA file you wish to download. This will download the\nzip file which contains both the\nactual 835 file\nand a readable text version (txt) of the ERA.\nYou’ll need to upload the 835 file to Jane. Jane can’t process the readable text version!\nOffice Ally gave me two remittance files. Which one should I upload to Jane?\nDownload the 835 file. The txt file is the paper remittance.\nHow do I download ERAs from Availity?\nHead into your\nClaims & Payments\nfolder, and select the\nRemittance Viewer\n. You’ll be able to download remittances on the next screen!\nIf you are having trouble locating your ERA’s in the correct format, you may need to enroll first. Below are some steps to walk you through the enrollment process.\nYou can start the enrollment for ERAs/EFTs by navigating to\nMy Providers > Enrollment Center > Transaction Enrollment.\nFrom here, select\nEnroll > Enroll a Provider.\nIf you would like your ERAs to be forwarded to another Clearinghouse besides Availity, make sure to check the box after selecting your Organization that states\n“Forward ERA files to another Clearinghouse”\nThe ERA files will now be delivered to your FTP mailbox located under\nClaims & Payments > Send/Receive EDI Files > Receive Files.\nHow do I download ERAs from TriZetto?\nYou can download new remittances in a folder in your account call\nRemits\n!.\nWe’re sorry this is so short! The TriZetto team doesn’t have any public resources available for downloading ERAs from their system that we can share here. They recommend that you go to the Resources tab in your account, and click Help Videos or Online Help. Both of these options have ERA-related content.\nHow do I download ERAs from Claim.MD?\nSelect\nView ERA\nwhich can be found under the Claim Menu. Next, select all the ERAs you haven’t processed yet (you can select multiple in one go!). The last step is click the Select Action dropdown, and choose the Download Selected 835 option.\nHow do I download ERAs from Waystar?\nAlthough we don’t explicitly support electronic claim submissions to Waystar, some Jane clinics continue to successfully use it for their insurance billing needs.\nHere’s how you can download a remittance from Waystar:\nHead to your Remits tab and click Payments.\nChoose your remit, click the dropdown arrow, and select Download.\nA new Downloads screen will appear. You’ll want to click Go To Downloads.\nLastly, head to the Downloads area in the Remits tab, and click the dropdown beside the remittance. This will download the ERA onto your device!\nHow do I upload an ERA from Claim.MD that wasn’t submitted through Jane?\nIn general, claims should be automatically syncing with Jane and if this is not the case, the recommendation here is to take a peek at your settings in Claim.MD.\nTo get started,, log into your Claim.MD account and head over to the\nSettings\ntab and then click on\nAccount Settings\n.\nFrom there, scroll down to the\nSFTP Settings\nsection and set the\nReceive ERA/835\nfield to\n*835\n.\nThis setting will make sure your ERAs are in the correct format so that they’re able to automatically drop into your Remittances folder in your Jane account.Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.\n500 - 138 13th Street East, North Vancouver\nBritish Columbia, Canada V7L 0E5\nContact Us\n+1 844-310-JANE (5263)\n+44 808 164 0893\n+61 1 800 940 893\n+1 604-670-JANE (5263)\nseejanerun@janeapp.com\nWant to keep up-to-date with everything that’s new in Jane?
