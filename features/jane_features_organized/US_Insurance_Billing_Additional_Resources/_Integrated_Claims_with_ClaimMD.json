Check out\nwhat’s new\nand see how our Claim.MD integration can help you manage your entire revenue cycle in Jane.\nHere’s what you’ll find in this guide:\nHow to connect Claim.MD with Jane for claim submissions\nSubmitting claims\nClaim acknowledgements and managing rejections\nReceiving insurer remittances\nBilling Community\nFAQs\nWatch the webinar\nHow to connect Claim.MD with Jane for claim submissions\nIn your Claim.MD account\nBefore connecting your Claim.MD account with Jane, you’ll need to log in to Claim.MD and adjust a couple of settings. Choose\nSettings\nfrom the list on the left and then click the\nAccount Settings\ntab at the top of the page.\nStart by setting the\nSFTP Active\nfield to\nYes\n.\n‼️ While on this screen, note down your SFTP Username and Password. The password is\nonly visible once\nin Claim.MD, so be sure to note down your password\nbefore leaving this page\n.\nSome other key settings to check:\nClaim Status Format\nshould be\n277\nReceive ERA/835\nshould be\n835\nTransmit Approval Required\nshould be\nunchecked\n(if it’s on, you’ll have to log in to Claim.MD to approve all claims submitted through the integration)\nTo disable transmit approval setting within Claim.MD, you’ll want to head over to\nSettings\nand click on the\nAccount Settings\ntab at the top. Then uncheck the\nTransmit Approval Required\noption.\nThese settings will ensure that Jane automatically sends claims to Claim.MD and that Claim.MD automatically sends claim acknowledgments (like Rejections) and\nERAs\nback to Jane.\nLast but not least, look for your Vendor Settings and check that you can see Jane listed as a Vendor. If you don’t see Jane listed, you’ll want to reach out to Claim.MD to let them know. Without this, they won’t know to apply the discount.\nIn your Jane account\nNow that you have your Claim.MD SFTP username and password, you can connect your Claim.MD account with Jane in\nSettings > Integrations > Clearinghouse\n.\nNext, enter your Claim.MD SFTP username and SFTP password — the username and password that you noted down when enabling SFTP in your Claim.MD account.\nNote that your SFTP login credentials are different than the username and password you use to login to your Claim.MD account.\nAnd that’s all! You’re ready to start billing through Integrated Claims with Claim.MD!\n🔝\nBack to table of contents\nSubmitting Claims\nIf you’ve been\nsubmitting claims electronically\nthrough Jane, this will feel pretty familiar (minus a few steps 😉).\nAfter selecting a batch of claims, simply click the Submit button in the submission preview. When you press this button, Jane will generate a batch submission and automatically send it to your Claim.MD account.\nYour claims will appear in your Claim.MD within 10 minutes of generating a submission.\nOnce you’ve submitted your claims, they’ll sit in the Submitted folder awaiting\nclaim acknowledgements\nfrom Claim.MD and insurance companies.\n🔝\nBack to table of contents\nClaim acknowledgements and managing rejections\nLet’s start with\nwhat\nclaim acknowledgements are, and why they’re important in the billing process.\nClearinghouses and insurers send claim acknowledgements to let you know they have\nreceived\nyour claims. A claim acknowledgement confirms whether a claim has made it through to the next billing ‘stage’ (i.e. adjudication by the payer), or if you need to fix your claim and resubmit (i.e. a rejection for invalid information).\nIn Jane, claim acknowledgements are displayed in the Claim Summary panel, which can be accessed when viewing a claim in your claim submission folders.\nIf a claim gets rejected by Claim.MD or the insurance company, Jane will automatically move it to the Rejected folder.\nFrom there, you can view the rejection reason in the claim summary panel. You can click the toggle to see the detailed rejection reason.\nOnce you address the rejection reason, you can mark the claim as unsubmitted in Jane, and resubmit it through the integration.\n🔝\nBack to table of contents\nReceiving insurer remittances\nJane checks for new electronic remittances (835) in your Claim.MD account every few hours.\nWhen you’ve been sent a new ERA, Claim.MD will automatically upload it to your Jane account so you can post the payment. If you’re new to posting ERA payments in Jane, check out\nthis handy guide.\nThe ‘count’ next to your Remittances folder (Billing > Remittances) keeps track of all ERAs that need your attention. When that count begins to climb, you’ll know you’re receiving new ERAs through the integration!\n🔝\nBack to table of contents\nBilling Community\nJane’s\nUS Billing Community\nis for our current customers and has members with lots of experience with our Integrated Claims with Claim.MD.🤩 \nEven better? You’ll have access to third-party billers who can help answer questions, provide tips, best practices, and more. 💙\n🔝\nBack to table of contents\nFAQs\n⭐️Can I connect one Claim.MD account to multiple Jane accounts? Or multiple Claim.MD accounts to one Jane account?\nNo\n, right now you can only connect one Jane account with one Claim.MD account. Trying to connect a single Claim.MD account to multiple Jane accounts will result in all of the ERAs from the Claim.MD account being sent to all connected accounts, which could be a HIPAA violation.\n⭐️Will Jane upload ERAs that were uploaded to my Claim.MD before I set up my integration?\nWhen you connect your Claim.MD account with Jane, Claim.MD will automatically send all\nnew\nremits to your Jane account. That said, any remittance that you received\nbefore\nyou set up your integration will not be sent to your Jane account.\nIf you have any old remittances in Claim.MD that aren’t in Jane yet, head to the View ERA section of Claim.MD, select those old ERAs, and select the\nSend to SFTP Server\noption.\nDon’t worry if you accidentally select an ERA that’s already in your Jane account. Jane will catch and ignore any duplicates!\n⭐️How often does Jane check for new electronic remittances (835)? How long does it take Jane to send Claims to Claim.MD?\nJane checks for new electronic remittances (835) in your Claim.MD account every few hours. That means that you could see a new remittance within your Claim.MD account that hasn’t yet been uploaded to Jane. But if that happens, there’s no need to worry! Jane will upload that remittance in the next few hours.\nOnce you submit a batch of claims, Jane will upload them to Claim.MD within 10 minutes.\n⭐️How can I tell if an ERA in my Claim.MD account has been uploaded to Jane?\nIf you’re unsure if an ERA has been uploaded to Jane, you can head to the View ERA section of your Claim.MD account and look for the\nSTFP Download\nicon. If you see the icon (shown in the screenshot below), that means the ERA has already been uploaded to your Jane account.\n⭐️If I fix & submit a rejected claim in Claim.MD, do I need to manually update that claim in Jane too?\nIf you fix the rejection directly in Claim.MD, all you need to do is give Jane a little time, and the claim \nwill 🪄automagically🪄 move from the Rejected folder to the Submitted folder.\nBehind the scenes, Claim.MD will send a ‘successful’ claim acknowledgement to Jane. When Jane sees that, we bump the claim over to Submitted.\nIt can take an hour or so after fixing the rejection for this to happen, so if you’re impatient (or just really want to see that updated right away!), you can manually move that claim to the Submitted folder.\n⭐️Am I able to submit and process Workers Comp Claims with the Claim.MD integration?\nYes\n, as long as the payer has an\nElectronic Payer ID\n. You’ll want to ensure to check the\nTransmit Approval Required\nto attach treatment notes to these claims.\nThis setting will hold claims so you can head over to Claim.MD and attach any relevant and required documentation. Next, had over to\nManage Claims\nwithin the left sidebar menu. Those claims will now be listed as\nPending Approval\n, and you’ll want to click on the\nView Claim\nbutton to the right.\nFrom here, you can click on the claim you’ll be able to click on the blue\nAttach Documents\ntext at the top of the page.\nLastly, click on the\nSave Claim\nbutton in the top right corner and approve transmit. For more details on this process, you can check out our guide on\nHow to Attach Supporting Documents to Claims in Claim.MD\n.\n⭐️Why did you integrate with Claim.MD?\nWe chose to integrate with Claim.MD for a few reasons…\nOur community loves billing with Jane and Claim.MD. Jane users who switched to Claim.MD have told us:\n- It provides a smoother and more likely-to-succeed billing process than their previous clearinghouse\n- Claim.MD is intuitive and easy to navigate\nClaim.MD has helper-first values that align with ours:\n- They focus on customer experience and provide good customer support\n- They’re willing to add new payers\n- They have transparent, no-surprises\npricing\nWorking with Claim.MD allows us to build a better integration, faster:\n- They have resources that allow us to build our own integration, which creates a more intuitive, cohesive billing experience for Jane users\n⭐️Will you be integrating with Office Ally, Availity, and/or TriZetto?\nWe don’t have any plans to build integrations with additional clearinghouses at the moment. The more integrations we build, the longer it will take for us to add more value to the insurance billing experience (things like eligibility checks), so we’re focussing on building one great billing experience with Claim.MD right now.\n⭐️I’m not using Claim.MD right now. Should I switch?\nWe think so! For all the reasons listed above, we believe Claim.MD is a great choice for Jane users. You will need to be using Claim.MD in order to enjoy our Integrated Claims feature, so if that’s something that will make your billing a lot easier (and we think it will 😉), it’s worth making the switch.\n🔝\nBack to table of contents\nWatch the webinar\nIn this 25-minute session, you’ll see a demo of Claim.MD, an overview of billing through the integration in Jane, some stats from our beta users, and what we’ll be building next.

Learn more about\nhow to get started\n.\nWith Integrated Claims, you can connect your Claim.MD account to do the following…\nSubmit claims (837)\nView claim acknowledgements and manage rejections (277)\nReceive insurer remittances (835)\n…all right inside your Jane account!\nWe’ve been making some updates to make insurance billing simpler. Check out\nwhat’s new\nand see how our Claim.MD integration can help you manage your entire revenue cycle in Jane.\nHere’s what you’ll find in this guide:\nHow to connect Claim.MD with Jane for claim submissions\nSubmitting claims\nClaim acknowledgements and managing rejections\nReceiving insurer remittances\nBilling Community\nFAQs\nWatch the webinar\nHow to connect Claim.MD with Jane for claim submissions\nIn your Claim.MD account\nBefore connecting your Claim.MD account with Jane, you’ll need to log in to Claim.MD and adjust a couple of settings. Choose\nSettings\nfrom the list on the left and then click the\nAccount Settings\ntab at the top of the page.\nStart by setting the\nSFTP Active\nfield to\nYes\n.\n‼️ While on this screen, note down your SFTP Username and Password. The password is\nonly visible once\nin Claim.MD, so be sure to note down your password\nbefore leaving this page\n.\nSome other key settings to check:\nClaim Status Format\nshould be\n277\nReceive ERA/835\nshould be\n835\nTransmit Approval Required\nshould be\nunchecked\n(if it’s on, you’ll have to log in to Claim.MD to approve all claims submitted through the integration)\nTo disable transmit approval setting within Claim.MD, you’ll want to head over to\nSettings\nand click on the\nAccount Settings\ntab at the top. Then uncheck the\nTransmit Approval Required\noption.\nThese settings will ensure that Jane automatically sends claims to Claim.MD and that Claim.MD automatically sends claim acknowledgments (like Rejections) and\nERAs\nback to Jane.\nLast but not least, look for your Vendor Settings and check that you can see Jane listed as a Vendor. If you don’t see Jane listed, you’ll want to reach out to Claim.MD to let them know. Without this, they won’t know to apply the discount.\nIn your Jane account\nNow that you have your Claim.MD SFTP username and password, you can connect your Claim.MD account with Jane in\nSettings > Integrations > Clearinghouse\n.\nNext, enter your Claim.MD SFTP username and SFTP password — the username and password that you noted down when enabling SFTP in your Claim.MD account.\nNote that your SFTP login credentials are different than the username and password you use to login to your Claim.MD account.\nAnd that’s all! You’re ready to start billing through Integrated Claims with Claim.MD!\n🔝\nBack to table of contents\nSubmitting Claims\nIf you’ve been\nsubmitting claims electronically\nthrough Jane, this will feel pretty familiar (minus a few steps 😉).\nAfter selecting a batch of claims, simply click the Submit button in the submission preview. When you press this button, Jane will generate a batch submission and automatically send it to your Claim.MD account.\nYour claims will appear in your Claim.MD within 10 minutes of generating a submission.\nOnce you’ve submitted your claims, they’ll sit in the Submitted folder awaiting\nclaim acknowledgements\nfrom Claim.MD and insurance companies.\n🔝\nBack to table of contents\nClaim acknowledgements and managing rejections\nLet’s start with\nwhat\nclaim acknowledgements are, and why they’re important in the billing process.\nClearinghouses and insurers send claim acknowledgements to let you know they have\nreceived\nyour claims. A claim acknowledgement confirms whether a claim has made it through to the next billing ‘stage’ (i.e. adjudication by the payer), or if you need to fix your claim and resubmit (i.e. a rejection for invalid information).\nIn Jane, claim acknowledgements are displayed in the Claim Summary panel, which can be accessed when viewing a claim in your claim submission folders.\nIf a claim gets rejected by Claim.MD or the insurance company, Jane will automatically move it to the Rejected folder.\nFrom there, you can view the rejection reason in the claim summary panel. You can click the toggle to see the detailed rejection reason.\nOnce you address the rejection reason, you can mark the claim as unsubmitted in Jane, and resubmit it through the integration.\n🔝\nBack to table of contents\nReceiving insurer remittances\nJane checks for new electronic remittances (835) in your Claim.MD account every few hours.\nWhen you’ve been sent a new ERA, Claim.MD will automatically upload it to your Jane account so you can post the payment. If you’re new to posting ERA payments in Jane, check out\nthis handy guide.\nThe ‘count’ next to your Remittances folder (Billing > Remittances) keeps track of all ERAs that need your attention. When that count begins to climb, you’ll know you’re receiving new ERAs through the integration!\n🔝\nBack to table of contents\nBilling Community\nJane’s\nUS Billing Community\nis for our current customers and has members with lots of experience with our Integrated Claims with Claim.MD.🤩 \nEven better? You’ll have access to third-party billers who can help answer questions, provide tips, best practices, and more. 💙\n🔝\nBack to table of contents\nFAQs\n⭐️Can I connect one Claim.MD account to multiple Jane accounts? Or multiple Claim.MD accounts to one Jane account?\nNo\n, right now you can only connect one Jane account with one Claim.MD account. Trying to connect a single Claim.MD account to multiple Jane accounts will result in all of the ERAs from the Claim.MD account being sent to all connected accounts, which could be a HIPAA violation.\n⭐️Will Jane upload ERAs that were uploaded to my Claim.MD before I set up my integration?\nWhen you connect your Claim.MD account with Jane, Claim.MD will automatically send all\nnew\nremits to your Jane account. That said, any remittance that you received\nbefore\nyou set up your integration will not be sent to your Jane account.\nIf you have any old remittances in Claim.MD that aren’t in Jane yet, head to the View ERA section of Claim.MD, select those old ERAs, and select the\nSend to SFTP Server\noption.\nDon’t worry if you accidentally select an ERA that’s already in your Jane account. Jane will catch and ignore any duplicates!\n⭐️How often does Jane check for new electronic remittances (835)? How long does it take Jane to send Claims to Claim.MD?\nJane checks for new electronic remittances (835) in your Claim.MD account every few hours. That means that you could see a new remittance within your Claim.MD account that hasn’t yet been uploaded to Jane. But if that happens, there’s no need to worry! Jane will upload that remittance in the next few hours.\nOnce you submit a batch of claims, Jane will upload them to Claim.MD within 10 minutes.\n⭐️How can I tell if an ERA in my Claim.MD account has been uploaded to Jane?\nIf you’re unsure if an ERA has been uploaded to Jane, you can head to the View ERA section of your Claim.MD account and look for the\nSTFP Download\nicon. If you see the icon (shown in the screenshot below), that means the ERA has already been uploaded to your Jane account.\n⭐️If I fix & submit a rejected claim in Claim.MD, do I need to manually update that claim in Jane too?\nIf you fix the rejection directly in Claim.MD, all you need to do is give Jane a little time, and the claim \nwill 🪄automagically🪄 move from the Rejected folder to the Submitted folder.\nBehind the scenes, Claim.MD will send a ‘successful’ claim acknowledgement to Jane. When Jane sees that, we bump the claim over to Submitted.\nIt can take an hour or so after fixing the rejection for this to happen, so if you’re impatient (or just really want to see that updated right away!), you can manually move that claim to the Submitted folder.\n⭐️Am I able to submit and process Workers Comp Claims with the Claim.MD integration?\nYes\n, as long as the payer has an\nElectronic Payer ID\n. You’ll want to ensure to check the\nTransmit Approval Required\nto attach treatment notes to these claims.\nThis setting will hold claims so you can head over to Claim.MD and attach any relevant and required documentation. Next, had over to\nManage Claims\nwithin the left sidebar menu. Those claims will now be listed as\nPending Approval\n, and you’ll want to click on the\nView Claim\nbutton to the right.\nFrom here, you can click on the claim you’ll be able to click on the blue\nAttach Documents\ntext at the top of the page.\nLastly, click on the\nSave Claim\nbutton in the top right corner and approve transmit. For more details on this process, you can check out our guide on\nHow to Attach Supporting Documents to Claims in Claim.MD\n.\n⭐️Why did you integrate with Claim.MD?\nWe chose to integrate with Claim.MD for a few reasons…\nOur community loves billing with Jane and Claim.MD. Jane users who switched to Claim.MD have told us:\n- It provides a smoother and more likely-to-succeed billing process than their previous clearinghouse\n- Claim.MD is intuitive and easy to navigate\nClaim.MD has helper-first values that align with ours:\n- They focus on customer experience and provide good customer support\n- They’re willing to add new payers\n- They have transparent, no-surprises\npricing\nWorking with Claim.MD allows us to build a better integration, faster:\n- They have resources that allow us to build our own integration, which creates a more intuitive, cohesive billing experience for Jane users\n⭐️Will you be integrating with Office Ally, Availity, and/or TriZetto?\nWe don’t have any plans to build integrations with additional clearinghouses at the moment. The more integrations we build, the longer it will take for us to add more value to the insurance billing experience (things like eligibility checks), so we’re focussing on building one great billing experience with Claim.MD right now.\n⭐️I’m not using Claim.MD right now. Should I switch?\nWe think so! For all the reasons listed above, we believe Claim.MD is a great choice for Jane users. You will need to be using Claim.MD in order to enjoy our Integrated Claims feature, so if that’s something that will make your billing a lot easier (and we think it will 😉), it’s worth making the switch.\n🔝\nBack to table of contents\nWatch the webinar\nIn this 25-minute session, you’ll see a demo of Claim.MD, an overview of billing through the integration in Jane, some stats from our beta users, and what we’ll be building next.
