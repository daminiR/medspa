Learn more about billing Unlisted CPT codes\nhere\n.\nWhen submitting to\nsecondary payers\n, oftentimes adjudication information from the primary payer is sent in this line.\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nYou can manually add info to this box after generating a CMS1500.\nBox 24a- Date(s) of Service\nWhat’s in the box?\nThis box indicates the date a procedure was performed. It contains a section for a\nFrom\nand\nTo\ndate, but these dates will always be the same in Jane.\n📌\nNote:\nIf your practice would like to be able to include a different date range in this box, let us know why!\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nThe date of the appointment on the Schedule (or purchase date of the product) is automatically used for every procedure.\nIs this required?\nYes - but there’s nothing extra you have to do to set this box.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nThe Date of Service is sent in\nLoop 2400 - Service Line Info\nFor\neach procedure\nbilled on a claim, the Date of Service is sent in\nLoop 2400, DTP03\nDTP01 includes the qualifier\n472\n, which means\nService\nBox 24b- Place of Service Code\nWhat’s in the box?\nThe\nPlace of Service\n(POS) code identifies the type of location where the service was rendered. There is a spot for a POS code for each procedure being billed.\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nWhen creating or editing a\nLocation\n, you can\nassign a default POS code\nthat will be the default for all of your treatments.\nThis is found in\nSettings > Locations > Edit > Place of Service Code.\nEach POS code is\ntwo digits\n, and we regularly update our list. If you can’t find a POS code that you need, then let us know and we’ll add it!\nIf you have some treatments that are offered in a different location than your default POS (virtual visits are a great example of this!) then you can override this by updating the POS code in the treatment setting.\nYou can read more about Place of Service codes here:\nSetting a Place of Service Code\n.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nThe Place of Service code is sent in\nLoop 2300 - Claim Info\n.\nSpecifically:\nThe Place of Service Code is sent in\nLoop 2300, Segment CLM05\nBox 24c- Emergency Service\nWhat’s in the box?\nThis Box indicates that the procedure was performed to address a medical emergency.\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nThis box is not currently supported in Jane (blank by default on the CMS1500). If your practice would like this box to be supported, let us know!\nBox 24d- CPT & Modifier(s)\nWhat’s in the box?\nThis Box indicates the procedure that was performed (applicable\nCPT code\n) as well as any\nModifiers\n(limit of 4) made on the procedure.\nOn each claim form, a maximum of\n6 procedures\ncan be billed.\n📍\nKey Note:\nThis limit only applies to the CMS1500. The limit of 6 procedures doesn’t apply to electronic submissions.\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nYou can add CPT codes to an appointment in multiple areas of Jane. From the\nSchedule\n, you can add CPT codes under the\nInsurance Info\nsection of the Appointment Panel.\nOnce you’ve added a code, you’ll be given the option to add a\nModifier.\nThere’s a little box under each CPT where you can do this. Simply type in your two-digit Modifier, and press the Enter on your keyboard.\n📍\nKey Note:\nThe order of the CPT codes on your claim form mirrors the order of the codes attached to the Insurance Policy in the Appointment Panel.\nBefore you start billing Insurance, you’ll want to make sure you’ve\nassigned fees\nto your CPT codes. This can be done in\nSettings > Billing Codes\n. For more info on setting up your billing codes, check out our Insurance Billing Course:\nUS Insurance Step 2\n.\nFor more info on adding CPT codes to your appointments, have a look at the following guide:\nStart Billing 2: CPT & Diagnosis codes\n.\nLastly, you can save some time when billing by setting up some\nDefault Modifiers\n. To learn how, you can check out our guide on\nBilling Code Default Allowed Amounts & Modifiers\n.\nIs this required?\nYou need\nat least one CPT\ncode to bill a claim, but Modifiers are\noptional.\nYou should follow instructions from the Insurance company if you’re unsure about Modifier requirements.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nCPT code info is sent in\nLoop 2400 - Service Line Info.\nAn\nSV1\nsegment is sent for each CPT code on the claim.\nSV101\nincludes both the CPT code and any modifiers assigned to that code\nSV101-02\nincludes the CPT code\nSV101-03\nincludes the CPT code modifier(s)\nCopy of Box 24e - Diagnosis Pointer\nWhat’s in the box?\nThis Box ‘points’ to the applicable diagnosis codes reported in\nBox 21\nfor each CPT code (i.e. Procedure 99204 was performed to treat the diagnosis A, B, and C). Note that the first code listed is the\nprimary diagnosis\n.\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nDiagnosis codes can be added to an\nAppointment\nas soon as you’ve added the CPT code(s). There’s a little box under each CPT code where you can add and rearrange your diagnosis codes.\nFor more info on adding CPT & diagnosis codes to your appointments, you can check out our guide:\nStart Billing 2: CPT & Diagnosis codes\n.\nIs this required?\nYes. Each procedure needs to point to at least one diagnosis code. However, Jane assigns the pointers on the claim for you based on which diagnosis codes you’ve added— and the order in which you’ve added them— to the appointment.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nCPT code info is sent in\nLoop 2400 - Service Line Info.\nAn\nSV1\nsegment\n**\nis sent for each CPT code on the claim.\nSV101 includes the CPT code\nSV107\nincludes the diagnosis code pointers\nEach sub-element of SV107 points to a specific diagnosis code. A procedure can point to a\nmaximum of 12 diagnosis codes\n.\nThe first diagnosis code (sub-element\nSV107-01\n) is the\nprimary diagnosis\nfor the procedure. Subsequent diagnosis codes are listed in an order of declining importance to the procedure.\n📍 Pro Tip\nOn the CMS1500, diagnosis pointers are managed with letters (A-L) but on the EDI they are managed with numbers (1-12).\nBox 24f - Charges (CPT Price)\nWhat’s in the box?\nThis Box indicates the price of a procedure (CPT code). Note that\nBox 28\nreflects the sum of all procedure charges.\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nBefore you start billing Insurance, you’ll want to make sure you’ve\nassigned fees\nto your CPT codes. This can be done in\nSettings > Billing Codes\n. For more info on setting up your billing codes, check out our Insurance Billing Course:\nUS Insurance Step 2\n.\nFor more info on adding CPT codes to your appointments, have a look at the following guide:\nStart Billing 2: CPT & Diagnosis codes\n.\nJane uses the price assigned to the CPT code (Settings > Billing Codes) for each procedure on the CMS1500.\n📍\nKey Note:\nThe price of the treatment (which is configured in Settings > Treatments & Classes)\nis not considered when billing Insurance\n. When you add a billing code to a visit in Jane, the billing code fee\noverrides the price of the treatment\n(aka your ‘cash’ price).\nIs this required?\nYes! A claim must have at least one CPT code, and if you don’t assign a price to your CPT codes, it will look like you’re billing $0 claims.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nCPT code fees are sent in\nLoop 2400 - Service Line Info.\nAn\nSV1\nsegment\n**\nis sent for each CPT code on the claim.\nSV101-02 includes the CPT code\nSV102\nincludes the\nprice\nof the CPT code\nBox 24g - CPT Units\nWhat’s in the box?\nThe number of billed units of a particular CPT code.\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nAfter adding a CPT code to an Appointment, you can change the number of units simply by clicking on the price of the code.\nFor more info on adding CPT codes to your appointments, have a look at the following guide:\nStart Billing 2: CPT & Diagnosis codes\n.\nIs this required?\nYes - each CPT code needs an assigned number of units. By default, CPT codes are billed for a\nsingle\nunit in Jane.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nCPT code info is sent in\nLoop 2400 - Service Line Info.\nAn\nSV1 segment\nis sent for each CPT code on the claim.\nSV101 includes the CPT code\nSV102 includes the price of the CPT code\nSV103 is hardcoded to\nUN\n, which indicates the procedure is billed in terms of units\n> 📍\nNote\n: we always send\nUN\n, but it is possible that some providers need to bill in\nminutes\ninstead of units, in which case\nMJ\nwould be needed. We don’t currently support minutes, but let us know if this is something your practice needs!\nSV104\nincludes the number of\nunits\nBox 24h - EPSDT/Family Planning\nWhat’s in the box?\nBox 24h is used to identify services that may be covered under specific state-funded plans.\nEPSDT info is sent in the shaded portion of 24H, while Family Planning info is sent in the unshaded portion of box 24H.\n📍Note that Jane supports EPSDT information on paper and electronic claims. If your practice would like support for Family Planning info, let us know!\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nClinics can set EPSDT Referral info in a patient’s insurance policy.\nBy default, this field will be set to “Not Applicable” for all insurance policies. When set to “Not Applicable”,  nothing will get sent in the shaded portion of Box 24H. If a different option is chosen, the corresponding qualifier code will be sent in the shaded portion of Box 24H (i.e.\nNU\nfor Not Used).\nIs this required?\nEPSDT information is only required by Medicaid in some states depending on your speciality and services.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nThe 837p implementation is a little more complicated than the CMS1500 implementation. It all depends on what you’ve selected in the patient’s policy!\nBox 24i - Rendering Provider ID Type\nWhat’s in the box?\nThis box indicates the type of identifying number that is reported in\nbox 24j\nof the CMS1500. This info helps the Insurer identify the rendering provider.\nThere is a\nshaded\nand\nunshaded\nsection of Box 24i for each service line.\nUnshaded:\nIncludes text ‘NPI’ by default.\nShaded:\nBlank by default.\nOnly used if a non-NPI rendering provider identifier (i.e. staff License number) or Rendering Provider Taxonomy Code needs to be reported.\nIf the shaded area of box 24i is used, then a 2-digit qualifier will be sent to identify the type of number being reported in box 24j.\nHere’s a list of qualifiers that are currently supported:\nState License (OB)\nProvider UPIN (1G)\nProvider Commercial Number (G2)\nLocation Number (LU)\nTaxonomy (ZZ)\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nThe Rendering Provider ID is set within a Staff Member’s Billing tab, specifically within the\nDefault Claim Information\nor within an\nInsurance Specific Claim Information\nform.\nThere’s nothing extra required to set box 24i if the Insurance company requires an NPI to identify the rendering provider!\nHowever, if the Insurance company requires a License number (a non-NPI ID), then you will need to click the\n‘Use License Number instead of NPI?’\noption when setting up your claim information and enter a\nLicense Number\nand\nLicense Type.\nThe\nLicense Type\nwill set the qualifier in box 24i of the CMS1500.\n📍\nKey Note:\nThe majority of Insurance companies require a Rendering Provider NPI. Only use a Rendering Provider License Number if advised to by the Insurance company.\nIf an Insurance company requires a Taxonomy Code to accompany the Rendering Provider NPI, then the qualifier ‘ZZ’ will be set in the shaded area of box 24i.\nIs this required?\nYou are\nrequired\nto specify the types of numbers that identify the Rendering Provider.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nThe Rendering Provider ID Type is sent in\nLoop 2310B - Rendering Provider Info\n. What qualifier is used and where it’s sent depends on whether the ID is an\nNPI\n(most common) or a\nLicense Number\n.\nIf an\nNPI\nis used, then the\n‘XX’\nqualifier will be included in\nLoop 2310B, Segment NM108\n.\nIf a\nTaxonomy Code\nis sent along with an\nNPI\n, then it is sent in\nLoop 2310B, Segment PRV.\nThe qualifier ‘PXC’, which is the EDI qualifier for Taxonomy Codes, is sent in PRV02\nThe Taxonomy Code is sent in PRV03\nIf a\nLicense Number\nis used, then the\nLicense Number Type\nyou’ve selected will determine the qualifier sent in\nLoop 2310B, Segment PRV02\n.\nHere is the list of Rendering Provider IDs available in Jane with their qualifiers in brackets:\nNPI (XX)\nState License (OB)\nProvider UPIN (1G)\nProvider Commercial Number (G2)\nLocation Number (LU)\nTaxonomy (PXC)\nBox 24j - Rendering Provider ID Number\nWhat’s in the box?\nThis box is used by the Insurer to identify the provider who performed the service— the Rendering Provider. Note that this box is closely linked with Box 24i, as well as the other sub-sections of box 24.\nThere is a\nshaded\nand\nunshaded\nsection of Box 24j for each service line.\nUnshaded:\nThe Rendering Provider NPI is reported in the unshaded section\nIf a Rendering Provider License ID is used in place of an NPI, then this section is left blank.\nShaded:\nIn some cases, an Insurer may require that a License or PIN be used instead of the NPI to identify the Rendering Provider. In these cases, the shaded section is used to report the license number.\nSome Insurers require the Rendering Provider to report the Taxonomy Code assigned to their NPI. In these cases, the Taxonomy Code is set in this box.\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nThe Rendering Provider ID of the\nstaff member receiving compensation\nfor the visit is used in Box 24j. This is typically the staff member who the patient is booked in with,\nbut not always\n(see the\nBilling Under a Different Staff Member\nsection below for more info).\nYou can check which\nStaff member\nis receiving compensation for an\nAppointment\nby hovering your mouse over the\nBilling Info\nsection of the\nAppointment Panel\nand clicking the blue\nView\nbutton that appears.\nRendering Provider IDs are set within a\nStaff Member’s Billing tab,\nspecifically within the\nDefault Claim Information,\nor within an\nInsurance Specific Claim Information\nform.\nThe Rendering Provider ID can either be set by adding a\nRendering Provider NPI\nor a\nLicense Number\n. Note that only\none\nRendering Provider ID can be set (Either an NPI, or a license number, but not both).\nTypically, the\nRendering Provider NPI\nwill be used as the Rendering Provider ID, but in some cases, an Insurance company may identify the rendering provider with a non-NPI identifier. In these cases, click the\n‘Use License Number instead of NPI?’\noption and enter a\nLicense Number\nand\nLicense Type\n📍\nKey Note:\nThe majority of Insurance companies require a Rendering Provider NPI. Only use a Rendering Provider License Number if advised to by the Insurance company.\n📍\nPro Tip:\nRendering Provider Taxonomy Codes- Some Insurance companies require the main Taxonomy Code assigned to the Rendering Provider NPI in order to identify the Rendering Provider.\nBilling Under a Different Staff Member\nIf you need to bill a claim under a different provider, then you’ll need to change the\nstaff member receiving compensation\nfor the Purchase. By default, the staff member receiving compensation will be the staff member with whom the patient is booked.\nFor example, let’s say that Andy is a student practicing under Susan. Some visits are booked in Andy’s Schedule, but we need to bill claims for those appointments under Susan’s credentials.\nFor each Insured visit in Andy’s Schedule, we’ll need to edit the Purchase and change the\nstaff member receiving compensation\nfrom Andy to Susan.\nTo do this, you can hover your mouse over the\nBilling Info\nsection of the\nAppointment Panel\nand click the blue\nView\nbutton that appears. This will lead you to the\nPurchase\nscreen, where you can use the blue\nChange\ntext next to the Staff Member’s name to switch Practitioners.\nKeep in mind that making this change will also affect your Reports. For example, each visit where the staff member receiving compensation is changed will show up under Susan’s\nSales\nand\nCompensation\nReports (instead of Andy’s).\nIs this required?\nA Rendering Provider ID (NPI or License) is\nrequired\nwhen billing paper and electronic claims. A Rendering Provider Taxonomy Code is\noptional\n.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nThe Rendering Provider ID is sent in\nLoop 2310B - Rendering Provider Info\n. Where it’s sent depends on whether the ID is an\nNPI\n(most common) or a\nLicense Number\n.\nIf an\nNPI\nis used, then it will be included in\nLoop 2310B, Segment NM109\n.\nIf a\nLicense Number\nis used, then it will be included in Loop 2310B,\nSegment REF02\n.\nNote that the License Number Type (the ‘qualifier’) will be included in Loop 2310B, Segment REF01 - but this maps to box\n24i\non the CMS1500\nHere is the list of Rendering Provider IDs available in Jane with their qualifiers in brackets:\nNPI (XX)\nState License (OB)\nProvider UPIN (1G)\nProvider Commercial Number (G2)\nLocation Number (LU)\nTaxonomy (PXC)\nIf a\nRendering Provider Taxonomy Code\nis used, then it is sent in\nLoop 2310B, Segment PRV\nThe qualifier ‘PXC’, which is the EDI qualifier for Taxonomy Codes, is sent in PRV02\nThe Taxonomy Code is sent in PRV03\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter.\nWelcome\nWelcome to the Jane Guide\nCode of Conduct\nFeature Requests\nJane's Brand Assets\nAccount Setup Consultations\nWhat's new in Jane?\nWhat's new in Jane Webinar\nJane's Changelog\nJane's Monthly Newsletter\nUpdates to Interchange Fees for Visa & Mastercard in Canada 🇨🇦\nHoward Spector joins Jane!\nJane Appoints Dan Davidow as Chief Marketing Officer\nJane App's Support Team Wins a Bronze Stevie® Award\nDemo Videos\nPractitioner's Home Base: Day Sheets & Charts\nJane in Action\nPractitioner Training:  Initial Signing In and Overview\nInsurance: Billing a Visit to a 3rd Party\nScheduling: Managing the Schedule with Many Practitioners\nDisciplines, Treatments, & Billing Settings\nSetting up Staff & Scheduling Shifts\nCharting: Signing, Duplicating & Symbols\nScheduling: Complete Schedule Overview\nBilling: Accepting Payments\nLaunching an Insurer Portal\nQuick Start\nStep 1: Clinic Information\nStep 2: Disciplines\nStep 3: Treatments\nStep 4: Staff\nStep 5: Schedule or Diary\nAdditional Set Up Recommendations\nPractitioner Step 1: Practitioner Training\nPractitioner Step 2: Treatments\nPractitioner Step 3: Shifts\nPractitioner Step 4: Online Booking\nPractitioner Step 5: Charting\nAccount Setup Consultations\nSwitching to Jane\nSwitching is easy with Jane on your team\nJane vs. SimplePractice\nAccount Basics\nHow To Check Who's Listed As Account Owner\nChecklist for Starting with Jane\nBrowser Requirements\nDevice & Network Recommendations\nUsing Jane on a Tablet\nUsing Jane on a Smartphone\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nAuto-Logout Duration\nUpdating Your Clinic Email Address & Phone Number\nLog In Help: Username and Password\nEnabling Patient Self Check-in\nAdding a Location\nBooking  a Break on a Mobile Device (Phone or other Small Screen)\nMoving Your Practice to a New Location\nMultiple Locations or Multiple Accounts: How to Set Up Jane for Independent Locations or Practitioners\nAccessibility in Jane\nI Can't Access My Jane Account: A Troubleshooting Guide\nHow to Archive a Treatment, Class or Group Appointment\nBookmarking Your Jane Account for Easy Access\nViewing Protected Financial Documents (For Patients)\nSwitching to the Balance Plan\nAdding a Billing Address for Locations\nUnauthorized Access: What to Do if Your Laptop/Phone is Lost or Stolen\nHow to Archive/Unarchive a Discipline\nHow to Change the Name of Your Clinic\nImporting to Jane\nHow to Import Data to Jane (Overview)\nBasics of Importing to Jane\nDiving Deeper Into Importing to Jane\nWhere Can You Import From?

If your practice would like this box to be supported, let us know!\nBox 24d- CPT & Modifier(s)\nWhat’s in the box?\nThis Box indicates the procedure that was performed (applicable\nCPT code\n) as well as any\nModifiers\n(limit of 4) made on the procedure.\nOn each claim form, a maximum of\n6 procedures\ncan be billed.\n📍\nKey Note:\nThis limit only applies to the CMS1500. The limit of 6 procedures doesn’t apply to electronic submissions.\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nYou can add CPT codes to an appointment in multiple areas of Jane. From the\nSchedule\n, you can add CPT codes under the\nInsurance Info\nsection of the Appointment Panel.\nOnce you’ve added a code, you’ll be given the option to add a\nModifier.\nThere’s a little box under each CPT where you can do this. Simply type in your two-digit Modifier, and press the Enter on your keyboard.\n📍\nKey Note:\nThe order of the CPT codes on your claim form mirrors the order of the codes attached to the Insurance Policy in the Appointment Panel.\nBefore you start billing Insurance, you’ll want to make sure you’ve\nassigned fees\nto your CPT codes. This can be done in\nSettings > Billing Codes\n. For more info on setting up your billing codes, check out our Insurance Billing Course:\nUS Insurance Step 2\n.\nFor more info on adding CPT codes to your appointments, have a look at the following guide:\nStart Billing 2: CPT & Diagnosis codes\n.\nLastly, you can save some time when billing by setting up some\nDefault Modifiers\n. To learn how, you can check out our guide on\nBilling Code Default Allowed Amounts & Modifiers\n.\nIs this required?\nYou need\nat least one CPT\ncode to bill a claim, but Modifiers are\noptional.\nYou should follow instructions from the Insurance company if you’re unsure about Modifier requirements.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nCPT code info is sent in\nLoop 2400 - Service Line Info.\nAn\nSV1\nsegment is sent for each CPT code on the claim.\nSV101\nincludes both the CPT code and any modifiers assigned to that code\nSV101-02\nincludes the CPT code\nSV101-03\nincludes the CPT code modifier(s)\nCopy of Box 24e - Diagnosis Pointer\nWhat’s in the box?\nThis Box ‘points’ to the applicable diagnosis codes reported in\nBox 21\nfor each CPT code (i.e. Procedure 99204 was performed to treat the diagnosis A, B, and C). Note that the first code listed is the\nprimary diagnosis\n.\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nDiagnosis codes can be added to an\nAppointment\nas soon as you’ve added the CPT code(s). There’s a little box under each CPT code where you can add and rearrange your diagnosis codes.\nFor more info on adding CPT & diagnosis codes to your appointments, you can check out our guide:\nStart Billing 2: CPT & Diagnosis codes\n.\nIs this required?\nYes. Each procedure needs to point to at least one diagnosis code. However, Jane assigns the pointers on the claim for you based on which diagnosis codes you’ve added— and the order in which you’ve added them— to the appointment.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nCPT code info is sent in\nLoop 2400 - Service Line Info.\nAn\nSV1\nsegment\n**\nis sent for each CPT code on the claim.\nSV101 includes the CPT code\nSV107\nincludes the diagnosis code pointers\nEach sub-element of SV107 points to a specific diagnosis code. A procedure can point to a\nmaximum of 12 diagnosis codes\n.\nThe first diagnosis code (sub-element\nSV107-01\n) is the\nprimary diagnosis\nfor the procedure. Subsequent diagnosis codes are listed in an order of declining importance to the procedure.\n📍 Pro Tip\nOn the CMS1500, diagnosis pointers are managed with letters (A-L) but on the EDI they are managed with numbers (1-12).\nBox 24f - Charges (CPT Price)\nWhat’s in the box?\nThis Box indicates the price of a procedure (CPT code). Note that\nBox 28\nreflects the sum of all procedure charges.\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nBefore you start billing Insurance, you’ll want to make sure you’ve\nassigned fees\nto your CPT codes. This can be done in\nSettings > Billing Codes\n. For more info on setting up your billing codes, check out our Insurance Billing Course:\nUS Insurance Step 2\n.\nFor more info on adding CPT codes to your appointments, have a look at the following guide:\nStart Billing 2: CPT & Diagnosis codes\n.\nJane uses the price assigned to the CPT code (Settings > Billing Codes) for each procedure on the CMS1500.\n📍\nKey Note:\nThe price of the treatment (which is configured in Settings > Treatments & Classes)\nis not considered when billing Insurance\n. When you add a billing code to a visit in Jane, the billing code fee\noverrides the price of the treatment\n(aka your ‘cash’ price).\nIs this required?\nYes! A claim must have at least one CPT code, and if you don’t assign a price to your CPT codes, it will look like you’re billing $0 claims.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nCPT code fees are sent in\nLoop 2400 - Service Line Info.\nAn\nSV1\nsegment\n**\nis sent for each CPT code on the claim.\nSV101-02 includes the CPT code\nSV102\nincludes the\nprice\nof the CPT code\nBox 24g - CPT Units\nWhat’s in the box?\nThe number of billed units of a particular CPT code.\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nAfter adding a CPT code to an Appointment, you can change the number of units simply by clicking on the price of the code.\nFor more info on adding CPT codes to your appointments, have a look at the following guide:\nStart Billing 2: CPT & Diagnosis codes\n.\nIs this required?\nYes - each CPT code needs an assigned number of units. By default, CPT codes are billed for a\nsingle\nunit in Jane.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nCPT code info is sent in\nLoop 2400 - Service Line Info.\nAn\nSV1 segment\nis sent for each CPT code on the claim.\nSV101 includes the CPT code\nSV102 includes the price of the CPT code\nSV103 is hardcoded to\nUN\n, which indicates the procedure is billed in terms of units\n> 📍\nNote\n: we always send\nUN\n, but it is possible that some providers need to bill in\nminutes\ninstead of units, in which case\nMJ\nwould be needed. We don’t currently support minutes, but let us know if this is something your practice needs!\nSV104\nincludes the number of\nunits\nBox 24h - EPSDT/Family Planning\nWhat’s in the box?\nBox 24h is used to identify services that may be covered under specific state-funded plans.\nEPSDT info is sent in the shaded portion of 24H, while Family Planning info is sent in the unshaded portion of box 24H.\n📍Note that Jane supports EPSDT information on paper and electronic claims. If your practice would like support for Family Planning info, let us know!\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nClinics can set EPSDT Referral info in a patient’s insurance policy.\nBy default, this field will be set to “Not Applicable” for all insurance policies. When set to “Not Applicable”,  nothing will get sent in the shaded portion of Box 24H. If a different option is chosen, the corresponding qualifier code will be sent in the shaded portion of Box 24H (i.e.\nNU\nfor Not Used).\nIs this required?\nEPSDT information is only required by Medicaid in some states depending on your speciality and services.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nThe 837p implementation is a little more complicated than the CMS1500 implementation. It all depends on what you’ve selected in the patient’s policy!\nBox 24i - Rendering Provider ID Type\nWhat’s in the box?\nThis box indicates the type of identifying number that is reported in\nbox 24j\nof the CMS1500. This info helps the Insurer identify the rendering provider.\nThere is a\nshaded\nand\nunshaded\nsection of Box 24i for each service line.\nUnshaded:\nIncludes text ‘NPI’ by default.\nShaded:\nBlank by default.\nOnly used if a non-NPI rendering provider identifier (i.e. staff License number) or Rendering Provider Taxonomy Code needs to be reported.\nIf the shaded area of box 24i is used, then a 2-digit qualifier will be sent to identify the type of number being reported in box 24j.\nHere’s a list of qualifiers that are currently supported:\nState License (OB)\nProvider UPIN (1G)\nProvider Commercial Number (G2)\nLocation Number (LU)\nTaxonomy (ZZ)\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nThe Rendering Provider ID is set within a Staff Member’s Billing tab, specifically within the\nDefault Claim Information\nor within an\nInsurance Specific Claim Information\nform.\nThere’s nothing extra required to set box 24i if the Insurance company requires an NPI to identify the rendering provider!\nHowever, if the Insurance company requires a License number (a non-NPI ID), then you will need to click the\n‘Use License Number instead of NPI?’\noption when setting up your claim information and enter a\nLicense Number\nand\nLicense Type.\nThe\nLicense Type\nwill set the qualifier in box 24i of the CMS1500.\n📍\nKey Note:\nThe majority of Insurance companies require a Rendering Provider NPI. Only use a Rendering Provider License Number if advised to by the Insurance company.\nIf an Insurance company requires a Taxonomy Code to accompany the Rendering Provider NPI, then the qualifier ‘ZZ’ will be set in the shaded area of box 24i.\nIs this required?\nYou are\nrequired\nto specify the types of numbers that identify the Rendering Provider.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nThe Rendering Provider ID Type is sent in\nLoop 2310B - Rendering Provider Info\n. What qualifier is used and where it’s sent depends on whether the ID is an\nNPI\n(most common) or a\nLicense Number\n.\nIf an\nNPI\nis used, then the\n‘XX’\nqualifier will be included in\nLoop 2310B, Segment NM108\n.\nIf a\nTaxonomy Code\nis sent along with an\nNPI\n, then it is sent in\nLoop 2310B, Segment PRV.\nThe qualifier ‘PXC’, which is the EDI qualifier for Taxonomy Codes, is sent in PRV02\nThe Taxonomy Code is sent in PRV03\nIf a\nLicense Number\nis used, then the\nLicense Number Type\nyou’ve selected will determine the qualifier sent in\nLoop 2310B, Segment PRV02\n.\nHere is the list of Rendering Provider IDs available in Jane with their qualifiers in brackets:\nNPI (XX)\nState License (OB)\nProvider UPIN (1G)\nProvider Commercial Number (G2)\nLocation Number (LU)\nTaxonomy (PXC)\nBox 24j - Rendering Provider ID Number\nWhat’s in the box?\nThis box is used by the Insurer to identify the provider who performed the service— the Rendering Provider. Note that this box is closely linked with Box 24i, as well as the other sub-sections of box 24.\nThere is a\nshaded\nand\nunshaded\nsection of Box 24j for each service line.\nUnshaded:\nThe Rendering Provider NPI is reported in the unshaded section\nIf a Rendering Provider License ID is used in place of an NPI, then this section is left blank.\nShaded:\nIn some cases, an Insurer may require that a License or PIN be used instead of the NPI to identify the Rendering Provider. In these cases, the shaded section is used to report the license number.\nSome Insurers require the Rendering Provider to report the Taxonomy Code assigned to their NPI. In these cases, the Taxonomy Code is set in this box.\nWhere does this info live in Jane?\nThe Rendering Provider ID of the\nstaff member receiving compensation\nfor the visit is used in Box 24j. This is typically the staff member who the patient is booked in with,\nbut not always\n(see the\nBilling Under a Different Staff Member\nsection below for more info).\nYou can check which\nStaff member\nis receiving compensation for an\nAppointment\nby hovering your mouse over the\nBilling Info\nsection of the\nAppointment Panel\nand clicking the blue\nView\nbutton that appears.\nRendering Provider IDs are set within a\nStaff Member’s Billing tab,\nspecifically within the\nDefault Claim Information,\nor within an\nInsurance Specific Claim Information\nform.\nThe Rendering Provider ID can either be set by adding a\nRendering Provider NPI\nor a\nLicense Number\n. Note that only\none\nRendering Provider ID can be set (Either an NPI, or a license number, but not both).\nTypically, the\nRendering Provider NPI\nwill be used as the Rendering Provider ID, but in some cases, an Insurance company may identify the rendering provider with a non-NPI identifier. In these cases, click the\n‘Use License Number instead of NPI?’\noption and enter a\nLicense Number\nand\nLicense Type\n📍\nKey Note:\nThe majority of Insurance companies require a Rendering Provider NPI. Only use a Rendering Provider License Number if advised to by the Insurance company.\n📍\nPro Tip:\nRendering Provider Taxonomy Codes- Some Insurance companies require the main Taxonomy Code assigned to the Rendering Provider NPI in order to identify the Rendering Provider.\nBilling Under a Different Staff Member\nIf you need to bill a claim under a different provider, then you’ll need to change the\nstaff member receiving compensation\nfor the Purchase. By default, the staff member receiving compensation will be the staff member with whom the patient is booked.\nFor example, let’s say that Andy is a student practicing under Susan. Some visits are booked in Andy’s Schedule, but we need to bill claims for those appointments under Susan’s credentials.\nFor each Insured visit in Andy’s Schedule, we’ll need to edit the Purchase and change the\nstaff member receiving compensation\nfrom Andy to Susan.\nTo do this, you can hover your mouse over the\nBilling Info\nsection of the\nAppointment Panel\nand click the blue\nView\nbutton that appears. This will lead you to the\nPurchase\nscreen, where you can use the blue\nChange\ntext next to the Staff Member’s name to switch Practitioners.\nKeep in mind that making this change will also affect your Reports. For example, each visit where the staff member receiving compensation is changed will show up under Susan’s\nSales\nand\nCompensation\nReports (instead of Andy’s).\nIs this required?\nA Rendering Provider ID (NPI or License) is\nrequired\nwhen billing paper and electronic claims. A Rendering Provider Taxonomy Code is\noptional\n.\nWhat about the EDI file?\nThe Rendering Provider ID is sent in\nLoop 2310B - Rendering Provider Info\n. Where it’s sent depends on whether the ID is an\nNPI\n(most common) or a\nLicense Number\n.\nIf an\nNPI\nis used, then it will be included in\nLoop 2310B, Segment NM109\n.\nIf a\nLicense Number\nis used, then it will be included in Loop 2310B,\nSegment REF02\n.\nNote that the License Number Type (the ‘qualifier’) will be included in Loop 2310B, Segment REF01 - but this maps to box\n24i\non the CMS1500\nHere is the list of Rendering Provider IDs available in Jane with their qualifiers in brackets:\nNPI (XX)\nState License (OB)\nProvider UPIN (1G)\nProvider Commercial Number (G2)\nLocation Number (LU)\nTaxonomy (PXC)\nIf a\nRendering Provider Taxonomy Code\nis used, then it is sent in\nLoop 2310B, Segment PRV\nThe qualifier ‘PXC’, which is the EDI qualifier for Taxonomy Codes, is sent in PRV02\nThe Taxonomy Code is sent in PRV03Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.\n500 - 138 13th Street East, North Vancouver\nBritish Columbia, Canada V7L 0E5\nContact Us\n+1 844-310-JANE (5263)\n+44 808 164 0893\n+61 1 800 940 893\n+1 604-670-JANE (5263)\nseejanerun@janeapp.com\nWant to keep up-to-date with everything that’s new in Jane?
