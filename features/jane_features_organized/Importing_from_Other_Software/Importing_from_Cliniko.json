If you have any difficulty while retrieving your data, it’s best to reach out directly to your current software provider.\n📹 Join us each month for our webinar “Everything You Need to Know About Switching to Jane”. We’ll walk you through the process of moving to Jane and share our top tips so that your import, setup, and onboarding run smoothly.\nSign up or learn more\n.\nIf you need to export all of your data from Cliniko—and not just items from a specific date range—select Any time to Any time under the date range field (this will make the fields appear blank; this is okay!). Check out the examples in their guidance, which is linked below.\nExporting your Patients from Cliniko\nComing from Cliniko, we’ll need you to upload your Client export with as much detail as possible.\nCliniko offers easy to use exports for your data, and you can head to the\nSettings Page\nand then find the\nData Exports\narea.\nHere’s a Help Doc from Cliniko’s support page on how to\nExport your Client List\n.\nExporting your Cliniko Appointments\nSame steps as above but using the\nAppointments\nfilter.\nThe default CSV format is fine for us to import.  And be sure to remember to run the entire date range of appointments (past and future!).\nExporting Charts from Cliniko\nClinko provides a CSV export of charts as well. We can use that export to import Cliniko charts in Jane formatted SOAP notes with the original signature and appointment dates.  These will not be editable after import.\nCliniko Billing Data\nWe don’t import billing information as there are formatting issues between the two systems.\nUploading into Jane\nTo ensure that your data is uploaded to the correct account, and for security reasons, we do not accept patient data via email.  You can upload the files to us in the Settings > Schedule an Import area.\nYou can find an overview of this process here:\nScheduling Your Import\nIf you need any further help getting all set up to run with Jane, just let us know!\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter.\nWelcome\nWelcome to the Jane Guide\nCode of Conduct\nFeature Requests\nJane's Brand Assets\nAccount Setup Consultations\nWhat's new in Jane?\nWhat's new in Jane Webinar\nJane's Changelog\nJane's Monthly Newsletter\nUpdates to Interchange Fees for Visa & Mastercard in Canada 🇨🇦\nHoward Spector joins Jane!\nJane Appoints Dan Davidow as Chief Marketing Officer\nJane App's Support Team Wins a Bronze Stevie® Award\nDemo Videos\nPractitioner's Home Base: Day Sheets & Charts\nJane in Action\nPractitioner Training:  Initial Signing In and Overview\nInsurance: Billing a Visit to a 3rd Party\nScheduling: Managing the Schedule with Many Practitioners\nDisciplines, Treatments, & Billing Settings\nSetting up Staff & Scheduling Shifts\nCharting: Signing, Duplicating & Symbols\nScheduling: Complete Schedule Overview\nBilling: Accepting Payments\nLaunching an Insurer Portal\nQuick Start\nStep 1: Clinic Information\nStep 2: Disciplines\nStep 3: Treatments\nStep 4: Staff\nStep 5: Schedule or Diary\nAdditional Set Up Recommendations\nPractitioner Step 1: Practitioner Training\nPractitioner Step 2: Treatments\nPractitioner Step 3: Shifts\nPractitioner Step 4: Online Booking\nPractitioner Step 5: Charting\nAccount Setup Consultations\nSwitching to Jane\nSwitching is easy with Jane on your team\nJane vs. SimplePractice\nAccount Basics\nHow To Check Who's Listed As Account Owner\nChecklist for Starting with Jane\nBrowser Requirements\nDevice & Network Recommendations\nUsing Jane on a Tablet\nUsing Jane on a Smartphone\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nAuto-Logout Duration\nUpdating Your Clinic Email Address & Phone Number\nLog In Help: Username and Password\nEnabling Patient Self Check-in\nAdding a Location\nBooking  a Break on a Mobile Device (Phone or other Small Screen)\nMoving Your Practice to a New Location\nMultiple Locations or Multiple Accounts: How to Set Up Jane for Independent Locations or Practitioners\nAccessibility in Jane\nI Can't Access My Jane Account: A Troubleshooting Guide\nHow to Archive a Treatment, Class or Group Appointment\nBookmarking Your Jane Account for Easy Access\nViewing Protected Financial Documents (For Patients)\nSwitching to the Balance Plan\nAdding a Billing Address for Locations\nUnauthorized Access: What to Do if Your Laptop/Phone is Lost or Stolen\nHow to Archive/Unarchive a Discipline\nHow to Change the Name of Your Clinic\nImporting to Jane\nHow to Import Data to Jane (Overview)\nBasics of Importing to Jane\nDiving Deeper Into Importing to Jane\nWhere Can You Import From?

If you have any difficulty while retrieving your data, it’s best to reach out directly to your current software provider.\n📹 Join us each month for our webinar “Everything You Need to Know About Switching to Jane”. We’ll walk you through the process of moving to Jane and share our top tips so that your import, setup, and onboarding run smoothly.\nSign up or learn more\n.\nIf you need to export all of your data from Cliniko—and not just items from a specific date range—select Any time to Any time under the date range field (this will make the fields appear blank; this is okay!). Check out the examples in their guidance, which is linked below.\nExporting your Patients from Cliniko\nComing from Cliniko, we’ll need you to upload your Client export with as much detail as possible.\nCliniko offers easy to use exports for your data, and you can head to the\nSettings Page\nand then find the\nData Exports\narea.\nHere’s a Help Doc from Cliniko’s support page on how to\nExport your Client List\n.\nExporting your Cliniko Appointments\nSame steps as above but using the\nAppointments\nfilter.\nThe default CSV format is fine for us to import.  And be sure to remember to run the entire date range of appointments (past and future!).\nExporting Charts from Cliniko\nClinko provides a CSV export of charts as well. We can use that export to import Cliniko charts in Jane formatted SOAP notes with the original signature and appointment dates.  These will not be editable after import.\nCliniko Billing Data\nWe don’t import billing information as there are formatting issues between the two systems.\nUploading into Jane\nTo ensure that your data is uploaded to the correct account, and for security reasons, we do not accept patient data via email.  You can upload the files to us in the Settings > Schedule an Import area.\nYou can find an overview of this process here:\nScheduling Your Import\nIf you need any further help getting all set up to run with Jane, just let us know!Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.\n500 - 138 13th Street East, North Vancouver\nBritish Columbia, Canada V7L 0E5\nContact Us\n+1 844-310-JANE (5263)\n+44 808 164 0893\n+61 1 800 940 893\n+1 604-670-JANE (5263)\nseejanerun@janeapp.com\nWant to keep up-to-date with everything that’s new in Jane?
