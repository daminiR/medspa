Here are a few guides on how to update your browser:\nHow to update your Google Chrome browser\nHow to update your Safari browser\nHow to update your Firefox browser\nHow to update your Microsoft Edge browser\nCheck your internet connection at\nfast.com\n. You will need a result of 15Mbps or higher. If you’re seeing a number measured in Kbps, that’s not good news. If your internet connection isn’t great, you will have the option to enable low data mode or shut off the video and do an audio-only session.\n📣\nHeads up\n: If you’re using an iPhone, iPad, or mac with\niOS 17 or macOS Sonoma\ninstalled, then Apple’s Reactions feature is enabled on your device by default. Reactions makes emojis appear onscreen when certain hand gestures (like a thumbs up) are made by participants in a video call.\nBelow are instructions to disable Reactions on your device. You’ll need to disable the feature on each device you use for video calls. If your client is using an Apple device with iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma installed and they don’t want to use Reactions, they’ll need to disable it on their device as well.\nOn Mac:\nCheck to see if you’re running iOS 17 or macOS Sonoma\n. If you aren’t, then you don’t need to complete the other steps until you’ve updated your device.\nTo disable Reactions, you need your camera to be in use. A simple way to do this is to open FaceTime and start a video call.\nClick the Video button in the menu bar, and then click Reactions.\nOn iPhone/iPad:\nCheck to see if you’re running iOS 17 or macOS Sonoma\n. If you aren’t, then you don’t need to complete the other steps until you’ve updated your device.\nTo disable Reactions, you need your camera to be in use. A simple way to do this is to open FaceTime and start a video call.\nAfter that, swipe down from the top right corner of the screen to bring up the Control Center. (Note that if you have an iPhone/iPad with the Home Button, you will need to double-press the Home button to show the Control Center).\nNow, tap on Video Effects\nFinally, tap on the Reactions button to turn it off.\nThe button should look like this once it’s turned off:\nAre Online Appointments secure and PIPEDA & HIPAA compliant?\nYes, all calls are GDPR, HIPAA, and PIPEDA compliant. To learn more, check out our\nOnline Appointments and Privacy Laws guide\n.\nWill I be able to record video, audio or chat communication?\nVideo, audio or chat communication\ncannot be recorded\nduring a Online Appointment (or virtual) session. This includes if the therapist is recording themselves, but not the client. This approach ensures that this feature remains HIPAA compliant and addresses major privacy concerns around Online Appointments posed by clinics.\nWhat is the pricing for your Online Appointments feature?\nThe 1:1 version of Jane’s Online Appointments is included in all pricing plans, at no extra cost.\nWe also have an Online Appointments for Groups feature which is available at $15 per month per practitioner. You can read more about our\nOnline Appointments for Groups feature here\n.\nDoes Jane offer Online Appointments for Groups?\nYes, we do have an Online Appointments for Groups feature which is available at $15 per month per practitioner. You can read more about our\nOnline Appointments for Groups feature here\n.\nDo you know whether patients are eligible to submit insurance claims for Online Appointments for my discipline and location?\nSome appointment types, depending on discipline are covered by third-party insurance payers. We would recommend checking in with your professional association OR the insurance company directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information on which appointment types are eligible for reimbursement and how to code and submit them. As you learn new info we’d love to hear about it! We will take what everyone learns and amalgamate it into a community database.\nIs the consent form shown prior to the session modifiable?\nThe consent form that is shown prior to the session is not modifiable at this time. There may be additional consent requirements set out by your local regulatory body and we recognize the importance of ensuring that this form can be customized. Although unavailable right now, this will be something that we look to implement in a future version of this feature.\nIn the meantime, some clinics have set up a separate consent form under\nSettings\n>\nForms\n>\nIntake Forms\nthat is sent to the client prior or during the session.\n💡Pro Tip: If you wanted this form to be sent out automatically to clients who book a video conference session for the first time, you could specify the Online Appointment treatments out of all your Session offerings.\nHere’s how it could look in the\nGeneral tab\nof your new consent form:\nThen in the\nAppointment Type\ntab, you can select the specific session(s) you created for the Online Appointment session.\nIf you would like to collect this consent prior to each session, you could set the form to be triggered manually, instead. Prior to the appointment, you will be able to send off the form via the client’s profile. This would follow a very similar process to what is described in our guide on\nUsing Intake Forms for Consent to Treatment\n.\nAlternatively, a provider could read out any additional consent items required to your client during the call and document their verbal consent in a designated section of your chart note for the session.\nIs the consent collected from my client prior to the session recorded somewhere in Jane?\nNot at this time. As we continue to improve the consent interface for Online Appointments, we intend to make sure that these consents are documented somewhere within the Jane platform. However, you cannot join a session without confirming the consent so joining a session indicates that consent was obtained.\nPlease see the question above,\n“Is the consent form shown prior to the session modifiable?”\n, for some alternatives on collecting and documenting consent in the meantime.\nWill I be required to set up a separate set of sessions to facilitate audio/video calls?\nYes, at this time we would recommend that you set up a separate set of sessions for Online Appointments.\nFor example, your session set-up may end up looking something like this:\nIn-Person Counselling Session (60-minutes)\nOnline Session (60-minutes)\nIn case it comes in handy, here is our step-by-step guide on\nSetting Up Online Appointments\nin your account.\nCan my patients prepay for their appointment / is there a way for them to add their credit card on file online?\nIf you’re using\nJane Payments\n, you can set an Online Booking Payment Policy. This allows you to charge for a session in full, take a deposit, or just collect credit card information when your clients book online. Your clients can also\nadd a credit card from their client profile\nafter they’ve booked online, or at any other time, through their client portal.\nIf you don’t have Jane Payments set up yet, don’t worry! You can still generate and download an invoice for the session to send to your client.\nHere’s a helpful guide on how you get started\ncollecting payments for Online Appointments\nwith each approach.\nDoes the practitioner need to join the call first or can the client start the call?\nEither party can join the call first. If your client joins the call first, a green badge will appear on their appointment saying, ‘Client is waiting’.\nWhen you join the call, you’ll see a\nLet in\nbutton that you can use to let them into the call.\nWhen your client (or clients) join the call, they can optionally test their audio, video and internet connection before entering the waiting room.\nOnce they enter the waiting room, they’ll see a message letting them know their practitioner will admit them shortly.\nIf you enter the call before your client, there will be a chime 🔔 to let you know when they have arrived. The\nAdmit Client\nbutton will light up blue and you can admit them whenever you’re ready.\nThe call will remain open indefinitely while at least one person is on the call. Either party will be able to join the call an hour before the appointment and up to an hour after.\nWhere can I find the link for a client to join a session virtually?\nIn general, clients will receive an Appointment Reminder email 30 minutes before their scheduled appointment time. If you need to resend a link to the client so they can join the session virtually, you can head over to their appointment on the\nSchedule\nand click on the blue\nRe-send Email Invitation\nlink:\nAdditionally, clients can join their sessions through the\nMy Account Patient Portal\n. They’ll want to head over to\nUpcoming Appointments\nwithin the left sidebar menu and click\nBegin\non the appointment.\nAre there any hardware requirements for Telehealth appointments?\nEach participant and the practitioner would need to be using devices with a Hardware Concurrency score of at least\n4\n. This relates to both your browser as well as to your computer’s CPU processing abilities.\nHere’s how you can find your Hardware Concurrency Number for your device:\nRight-click anywhere in an open\nChrome\nwindow and select\nInspect\nfrom the menu options.\nNext, you can click\nConsole\nat the top of the panel on the right. Type in\nnavigator.hardwareConcurrency\nand hit enter. This area is case-sensitive, so you’ll want to make sure that you type it in exactly as it’s shown.\nYou can take note of the number displayed here. If the number is 4 or less, the device can’t support Gallery View.\nCan I turn on closed captions for my telehealth sessions?\nWhile it’s not a direct feature in Jane at the moment, you can toggle on captioning in your Chrome browser. Head over to\nChrome’s Settings\nby clicking on the\nthree vertical black dots\n.\nFrom there, click on\nAccessibility\nwithin the left sidebar menu and then toggle on\nLive Captions\n:\nWhat camera resolution is required for Telehealth appointments?\nWe currently don’t have a camera resolution requirement for online appointments.  For the smoothest experience, you’ll want to ensure that your internet speed is\n15Mbps or higher\n, and both your device and browser are up-to-date. Check out our guide on\nDevice & Network Recommendations\nfor more details.\nHow can I disable the Pre-Call Test that pops up before my virtual appointment?\nTo disable the Pre-call Test, click the\ngear icon\nin the upper right corner of your online appointment screen to open\nSettings\n.\nThen select the\nAdvanced\ntab and switch the\nPre-call review\ntoggle to off.\nNote\n📝:\nToggling off this feature disables the Pre-call Test for any future online sessions that the user joins.\nCan files be shared during an online appointment?\nYes,\nany session participant can attach files from their device, using a file picker or drag and drop into the chat. After you click on the\nChat\nicon, you’ll want to click on the\npaperclip\nicon within the chat panel. Each file is presented in the chat window as an individual message and all session participants can download them. Staff members are able to delete any file shared, removing any unnecessary or incorrect files to keep the session organised.\nThe following file types can be uploaded:\nImages\n: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP\nDocuments\n: PDF, DOCX, TXT, RTF, CSV, XLSX\nAudio\n: MP3, WAV\nVideo\n: MP4, MOV, MKV, WEBM\nNote\n📝:\nThe maximum file size that can be uploaded is 15MB to maintain optimal session performance.\nCan I send my own Zoom link included in the appointment reminder if I’m not using Jane’s Online Appointments feature?\nCurrently, there isn’t a way to change the invite link sent along to a patient if the appointment is set up as an Online Appointment in Jane. However, there is an option if you have\none shared link\nfor a specific session type (i.e. a series of online classes), rather than separate links for each client or appointment date and time.\nA staff member with\nFull Access\ncan head over to the\nSettings\ntab, click on\nSessions, Classes & Group Appointments\n, and\nEdit\nto the right of the session.\nFrom there, you’ll want to change the session from Online to\nIn-Person\nto ensure the client does not receive Jane’s invitation link.\nNext, scroll down to the\nDetails\nsection and add any instructions you’d like, along with a link to join the session to the\nBooking Information (After Booking)\nsection.\nCheck out our\nEmail Customization Cheatsheet (Appointment Reminder)\nguide for more details on other areas of the appointment reminder that can be customized.\n💡1:1 telehealth is included in all of our pricing plans, including the Balance Plan.\nLearn more.\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter.\nWelcome\nWelcome to the Jane Guide\nCode of Conduct\nFeature Requests\nJane's Brand Assets\nAccount Setup Consultations\nWhat's new in Jane?\nWhat's new in Jane Webinar\nJane's Changelog\nJane's Monthly Newsletter\nUpdates to Interchange Fees for Visa & Mastercard in Canada 🇨🇦\nHoward Spector joins Jane!\nJane Appoints Dan Davidow as Chief Marketing Officer\nJane App's Support Team Wins a Bronze Stevie® Award\nDemo Videos\nPractitioner's Home Base: Day Sheets & Charts\nJane in Action\nPractitioner Training:  Initial Signing In and Overview\nInsurance: Billing a Visit to a 3rd Party\nScheduling: Managing the Schedule with Many Practitioners\nDisciplines, Treatments, & Billing Settings\nSetting up Staff & Scheduling Shifts\nCharting: Signing, Duplicating & Symbols\nScheduling: Complete Schedule Overview\nBilling: Accepting Payments\nLaunching an Insurer Portal\nQuick Start\nStep 1: Clinic Information\nStep 2: Disciplines\nStep 3: Treatments\nStep 4: Staff\nStep 5: Schedule or Diary\nAdditional Set Up Recommendations\nPractitioner Step 1: Practitioner Training\nPractitioner Step 2: Treatments\nPractitioner Step 3: Shifts\nPractitioner Step 4: Online Booking\nPractitioner Step 5: Charting\nAccount Setup Consultations\nSwitching to Jane\nSwitching is easy with Jane on your team\nJane vs. SimplePractice\nAccount Basics\nHow To Check Who's Listed As Account Owner\nChecklist for Starting with Jane\nBrowser Requirements\nDevice & Network Recommendations\nUsing Jane on a Tablet\nUsing Jane on a Smartphone\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nAuto-Logout Duration\nUpdating Your Clinic Email Address & Phone Number\nLog In Help: Username and Password\nEnabling Patient Self Check-in\nAdding a Location\nBooking  a Break on a Mobile Device (Phone or other Small Screen)\nMoving Your Practice to a New Location\nMultiple Locations or Multiple Accounts: How to Set Up Jane for Independent Locations or Practitioners\nAccessibility in Jane\nI Can't Access My Jane Account: A Troubleshooting Guide\nHow to Archive a Treatment, Class or Group Appointment\nBookmarking Your Jane Account for Easy Access\nViewing Protected Financial Documents (For Patients)\nSwitching to the Balance Plan\nAdding a Billing Address for Locations\nUnauthorized Access: What to Do if Your Laptop/Phone is Lost or Stolen\nHow to Archive/Unarchive a Discipline\nHow to Change the Name of Your Clinic\nImporting to Jane\nHow to Import Data to Jane (Overview)\nBasics of Importing to Jane\nDiving Deeper Into Importing to Jane\nWhere Can You Import From?

Here are a few guides on how to update your browser:\nHow to update your Google Chrome browser\nHow to update your Safari browser\nHow to update your Firefox browser\nHow to update your Microsoft Edge browser\nCheck your internet connection at\nfast.com\n. You will need a result of 15Mbps or higher. If you’re seeing a number measured in Kbps, that’s not good news. If your internet connection isn’t great, you will have the option to enable low data mode or shut off the video and do an audio-only session.\n📣\nHeads up\n: If you’re using an iPhone, iPad, or mac with\niOS 17 or macOS Sonoma\ninstalled, then Apple’s Reactions feature is enabled on your device by default. Reactions makes emojis appear onscreen when certain hand gestures (like a thumbs up) are made by participants in a video call.\nBelow are instructions to disable Reactions on your device. You’ll need to disable the feature on each device you use for video calls. If your client is using an Apple device with iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma installed and they don’t want to use Reactions, they’ll need to disable it on their device as well.\nOn Mac:\nCheck to see if you’re running iOS 17 or macOS Sonoma\n. If you aren’t, then you don’t need to complete the other steps until you’ve updated your device.\nTo disable Reactions, you need your camera to be in use. A simple way to do this is to open FaceTime and start a video call.\nClick the Video button in the menu bar, and then click Reactions.\nOn iPhone/iPad:\nCheck to see if you’re running iOS 17 or macOS Sonoma\n. If you aren’t, then you don’t need to complete the other steps until you’ve updated your device.\nTo disable Reactions, you need your camera to be in use. A simple way to do this is to open FaceTime and start a video call.\nAfter that, swipe down from the top right corner of the screen to bring up the Control Center. (Note that if you have an iPhone/iPad with the Home Button, you will need to double-press the Home button to show the Control Center).\nNow, tap on Video Effects\nFinally, tap on the Reactions button to turn it off.\nThe button should look like this once it’s turned off:\nAre Online Appointments secure and PIPEDA & HIPAA compliant?\nYes, all calls are GDPR, HIPAA, and PIPEDA compliant. To learn more, check out our\nOnline Appointments and Privacy Laws guide\n.\nWill I be able to record video, audio or chat communication?\nVideo, audio or chat communication\ncannot be recorded\nduring a Online Appointment (or virtual) session. This includes if the therapist is recording themselves, but not the client. This approach ensures that this feature remains HIPAA compliant and addresses major privacy concerns around Online Appointments posed by clinics.\nWhat is the pricing for your Online Appointments feature?\nThe 1:1 version of Jane’s Online Appointments is included in all pricing plans, at no extra cost.\nWe also have an Online Appointments for Groups feature which is available at $15 per month per practitioner. You can read more about our\nOnline Appointments for Groups feature here\n.\nDoes Jane offer Online Appointments for Groups?\nYes, we do have an Online Appointments for Groups feature which is available at $15 per month per practitioner. You can read more about our\nOnline Appointments for Groups feature here\n.\nDo you know whether patients are eligible to submit insurance claims for Online Appointments for my discipline and location?\nSome appointment types, depending on discipline are covered by third-party insurance payers. We would recommend checking in with your professional association OR the insurance company directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information on which appointment types are eligible for reimbursement and how to code and submit them. As you learn new info we’d love to hear about it! We will take what everyone learns and amalgamate it into a community database.\nIs the consent form shown prior to the session modifiable?\nThe consent form that is shown prior to the session is not modifiable at this time. There may be additional consent requirements set out by your local regulatory body and we recognize the importance of ensuring that this form can be customized. Although unavailable right now, this will be something that we look to implement in a future version of this feature.\nIn the meantime, some clinics have set up a separate consent form under\nSettings\n>\nForms\n>\nIntake Forms\nthat is sent to the client prior or during the session.\n💡Pro Tip: If you wanted this form to be sent out automatically to clients who book a video conference session for the first time, you could specify the Online Appointment treatments out of all your Session offerings.\nHere’s how it could look in the\nGeneral tab\nof your new consent form:\nThen in the\nAppointment Type\ntab, you can select the specific session(s) you created for the Online Appointment session.\nIf you would like to collect this consent prior to each session, you could set the form to be triggered manually, instead. Prior to the appointment, you will be able to send off the form via the client’s profile. This would follow a very similar process to what is described in our guide on\nUsing Intake Forms for Consent to Treatment\n.\nAlternatively, a provider could read out any additional consent items required to your client during the call and document their verbal consent in a designated section of your chart note for the session.\nIs the consent collected from my client prior to the session recorded somewhere in Jane?\nNot at this time. As we continue to improve the consent interface for Online Appointments, we intend to make sure that these consents are documented somewhere within the Jane platform. However, you cannot join a session without confirming the consent so joining a session indicates that consent was obtained.\nPlease see the question above,\n“Is the consent form shown prior to the session modifiable?”\n, for some alternatives on collecting and documenting consent in the meantime.\nWill I be required to set up a separate set of sessions to facilitate audio/video calls?\nYes, at this time we would recommend that you set up a separate set of sessions for Online Appointments.\nFor example, your session set-up may end up looking something like this:\nIn-Person Counselling Session (60-minutes)\nOnline Session (60-minutes)\nIn case it comes in handy, here is our step-by-step guide on\nSetting Up Online Appointments\nin your account.\nCan my patients prepay for their appointment / is there a way for them to add their credit card on file online?\nIf you’re using\nJane Payments\n, you can set an Online Booking Payment Policy. This allows you to charge for a session in full, take a deposit, or just collect credit card information when your clients book online. Your clients can also\nadd a credit card from their client profile\nafter they’ve booked online, or at any other time, through their client portal.\nIf you don’t have Jane Payments set up yet, don’t worry! You can still generate and download an invoice for the session to send to your client.\nHere’s a helpful guide on how you get started\ncollecting payments for Online Appointments\nwith each approach.\nDoes the practitioner need to join the call first or can the client start the call?\nEither party can join the call first. If your client joins the call first, a green badge will appear on their appointment saying, ‘Client is waiting’.\nWhen you join the call, you’ll see a\nLet in\nbutton that you can use to let them into the call.\nWhen your client (or clients) join the call, they can optionally test their audio, video and internet connection before entering the waiting room.\nOnce they enter the waiting room, they’ll see a message letting them know their practitioner will admit them shortly.\nIf you enter the call before your client, there will be a chime 🔔 to let you know when they have arrived. The\nAdmit Client\nbutton will light up blue and you can admit them whenever you’re ready.\nThe call will remain open indefinitely while at least one person is on the call. Either party will be able to join the call an hour before the appointment and up to an hour after.\nWhere can I find the link for a client to join a session virtually?\nIn general, clients will receive an Appointment Reminder email 30 minutes before their scheduled appointment time. If you need to resend a link to the client so they can join the session virtually, you can head over to their appointment on the\nSchedule\nand click on the blue\nRe-send Email Invitation\nlink:\nAdditionally, clients can join their sessions through the\nMy Account Patient Portal\n. They’ll want to head over to\nUpcoming Appointments\nwithin the left sidebar menu and click\nBegin\non the appointment.\nAre there any hardware requirements for Telehealth appointments?\nEach participant and the practitioner would need to be using devices with a Hardware Concurrency score of at least\n4\n. This relates to both your browser as well as to your computer’s CPU processing abilities.\nHere’s how you can find your Hardware Concurrency Number for your device:\nRight-click anywhere in an open\nChrome\nwindow and select\nInspect\nfrom the menu options.\nNext, you can click\nConsole\nat the top of the panel on the right. Type in\nnavigator.hardwareConcurrency\nand hit enter. This area is case-sensitive, so you’ll want to make sure that you type it in exactly as it’s shown.\nYou can take note of the number displayed here. If the number is 4 or less, the device can’t support Gallery View.\nCan I turn on closed captions for my telehealth sessions?\nWhile it’s not a direct feature in Jane at the moment, you can toggle on captioning in your Chrome browser. Head over to\nChrome’s Settings\nby clicking on the\nthree vertical black dots\n.\nFrom there, click on\nAccessibility\nwithin the left sidebar menu and then toggle on\nLive Captions\n:\nWhat camera resolution is required for Telehealth appointments?\nWe currently don’t have a camera resolution requirement for online appointments.  For the smoothest experience, you’ll want to ensure that your internet speed is\n15Mbps or higher\n, and both your device and browser are up-to-date. Check out our guide on\nDevice & Network Recommendations\nfor more details.\nHow can I disable the Pre-Call Test that pops up before my virtual appointment?\nTo disable the Pre-call Test, click the\ngear icon\nin the upper right corner of your online appointment screen to open\nSettings\n.\nThen select the\nAdvanced\ntab and switch the\nPre-call review\ntoggle to off.\nNote\n📝:\nToggling off this feature disables the Pre-call Test for any future online sessions that the user joins.\nCan files be shared during an online appointment?\nYes,\nany session participant can attach files from their device, using a file picker or drag and drop into the chat. After you click on the\nChat\nicon, you’ll want to click on the\npaperclip\nicon within the chat panel. Each file is presented in the chat window as an individual message and all session participants can download them. Staff members are able to delete any file shared, removing any unnecessary or incorrect files to keep the session organised.\nThe following file types can be uploaded:\nImages\n: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP\nDocuments\n: PDF, DOCX, TXT, RTF, CSV, XLSX\nAudio\n: MP3, WAV\nVideo\n: MP4, MOV, MKV, WEBM\nNote\n📝:\nThe maximum file size that can be uploaded is 15MB to maintain optimal session performance.\nCan I send my own Zoom link included in the appointment reminder if I’m not using Jane’s Online Appointments feature?\nCurrently, there isn’t a way to change the invite link sent along to a patient if the appointment is set up as an Online Appointment in Jane. However, there is an option if you have\none shared link\nfor a specific session type (i.e. a series of online classes), rather than separate links for each client or appointment date and time.\nA staff member with\nFull Access\ncan head over to the\nSettings\ntab, click on\nSessions, Classes & Group Appointments\n, and\nEdit\nto the right of the session.\nFrom there, you’ll want to change the session from Online to\nIn-Person\nto ensure the client does not receive Jane’s invitation link.\nNext, scroll down to the\nDetails\nsection and add any instructions you’d like, along with a link to join the session to the\nBooking Information (After Booking)\nsection.\nCheck out our\nEmail Customization Cheatsheet (Appointment Reminder)\nguide for more details on other areas of the appointment reminder that can be customized.\n💡1:1 telehealth is included in all of our pricing plans, including the Balance Plan.\nLearn more.Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.\n500 - 138 13th Street East, North Vancouver\nBritish Columbia, Canada V7L 0E5\nContact Us\n+1 844-310-JANE (5263)\n+44 808 164 0893\n+61 1 800 940 893\n+1 604-670-JANE (5263)\nseejanerun@janeapp.com\nWant to keep up-to-date with everything that’s new in Jane?
