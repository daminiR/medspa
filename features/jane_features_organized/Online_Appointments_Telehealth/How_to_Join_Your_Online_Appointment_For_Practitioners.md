How to Join Your Online Appointment (For Practitioners)
11 min read
So you’ve gone ahead and set up some
Online Appointments
, and are looking to start booking your clients in. Well, you’ve come to the right place!
Feel free to jump to one of the sections below:
Booking an Online Appointment
How to join a call
The waiting room
Settings and Features
Ending the call
If your client is having a bit of trouble connecting to the 1:1 Online Appointment from their end, we have a companion guide that you can direct them to here:
How to Join Your Online Appointment (for Clients)
.
Booking an Online Appointment
When it comes to scheduling an Online Appointment with one of your clients, the process is very similar to how you currently book a standard in-person session.
From the
Schedule
, click the date and time that you would like to book the session. When the Appointment Panel appears, choose the client (or clients) that you’ll be working with, then choose the Online Appointment type from the drop-down menu.
Next, you can add any additional details like an insurance claim or a note, before clicking the
Book Appointment
button.
Jane also has tools to offer Online Appointments for Groups of up to 12 participants. For some info on setting this up, check out
this guide
.
In addition to any normal session reminders and Thanks for Booking emails the clients receive, Jane will also send an email to the client with a direct link to join the call 30 minutes before an Online Appointment. This is the primary way for a client to join the session, so it’s good to double-check that the email address on file is correct.
💡 If you hear from clients that they haven’t received the email reminder, check the reminder is enabled and check the client’s profile to make sure they have opted in for that notification.
You can also manually trigger this link to go just prior to your online appointment by clicking on the appointment on the
Schedule
or from the
Day View
and click the blue
Re-Send Email Invitation
text on the appointment panel.
How to join a call
To get the most out of your Online Appointment, we’d recommend using the latest version of your web browser. Here are a few guides on how to update your browser:
How to update your Google Chrome browser
How to update your Safari browser
How to update your Firefox browser
How to update your Microsoft Edge browser
You can join a call by clicking on the appointment and then clicking the
Begin
button in the appointment panel. The
Begin
button will be available 1 hour before the session starts and will disappear 1 hour after the session ends.
Once you’ve clicked the
Begin
button, a new window will pop out and you may see a screen asking you to request permissions for your web browser to use your camera and microphone.
Click the blue
Request permissions
button and then we recommend choosing
Allow while visiting this site
so you won’t have to grant permissions each time you start an online appointment.
Next, you can run a quick test of your camera, microphone, speaker, and internet connection by clicking the blue
Run Test
button or you can skip the test if you prefer.
After the test screen, you can change which camera and microphone you’re using and adjust your video settings by clicking the cogwheel. You’ll have access to these settings while in the call as well.
When everything looks good, click the blue
Join meeting
button.
The waiting room
Once your client (or clients) joins the call, they’ll be in the waiting room. If you are on the call when they enter the waiting room, you’ll hear a notification chime.
You can click the blue
Let in
button to admit them or write them a quick message if you need more time.
Once you’ve let a client into the call, the timer in the upper left corner will begin and will be visible for both you and the other participants.
Settings and Features
Here are the different settings you can adjust during the call:
Hover your mouse over your camera or microphone icon to adjust your settings
Click the
Share
button to share your screen. (Please note, you can only share your screen using a laptop or desktop computer.)
Click the
People
button to see the participants. You can remove participants from this panel, or turn cameras or microphones off.
Adjusting the size of your video tile
By default, you’ll start the call in Pop out view, so you’ll see your own tile smaller than the other participants.
💡 Looking for tips on how to adjust your windows to chart during your call? Check out our guide on
Tips for Charting During Your Online Appointment
.
Gallery view
To make your tile the
same size
as the others in the call, you can turn off Pop out view by clicking the
Pop out
button on your video tile.
Hide-self view
To minimize or hide your tile, first make sure the
Pop out
option in the upper-right corner of your tile is selected. On mobile devices, you’ll find it by clicking the three dots on your tile.
Then, to hide your tile completely, hover over it and click the arrow on the left to tuck it away. You can get your tile back by clicking the arrow again.
Spotlight
If you want to make a participant’s video tile larger for everyone, you can click the
Spotlight
button in the upper-right corner of their video tile.
To remove it, just click
Spotlight off
.
Video & Audio Settings
To adjust audio or video settings, after you click on the
cogwheel icon
, you’ll want to click on
Video & Audio
within the left sidebar menu. Here you’ll have the option of selecting where the audio or video comes from. If you have an external camera or wireless headphones, here’s where you’ll want to select them.
Noise Reduction:
This toggle helps reduce the amount of background noise from your environment.
HD Video:
can be turned on if you’d prefer a higher video quality, but keep in mind you’ll want to ensure you have a strong internet connection
Widescreen Video:
Jane will automatically select a resolution based on the speed and reliability of your network, as well as the processing capabilities of your computer. We support up to 720p with 30fps at both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios.
Mirror:
Often called “self-view”, it’s a setting that controls where you appear as others see you (unmirrored) or flipped horizontally like a mirror reflection (mirrored).
General
Here, you can select the language and the skin tones for reactions.
Advanced
There are several settings here that you can adjust depending on your preferences:
Pre-call Review:
When this setting is toggled on, you and your patients will always be asked to confirm your device settings before joining the session
Low data mode/Reduce Visual Effects:
This setting is ideal if your network connection isn’t the strongest by decreasing the video resolution, disabling background effects/filters, and frame rate to prioritize audio quality.
Automatically launch picture-in-picture:
This setting in video calls allows you to see your video meeting in a small, floating window while you work in other browser tabs.
Keyboard shortcuts
: You can enable or disable the ability to for clients to use their keyboard to control certain settings within the call. Here are the shortcuts that you can use if this feature is toggled on:

The effects section lets you blur your background, select one of our virtual background images, or alternatively, you can upload a custom background image. This feature can be accessed directly from the
Settings
menu or when
hovering over the camera icon
from the toolbar below:
Or in the waiting room before you enter the call:
Selecting either option will open the
Effects
section of the
Settings
menu with the background options we offer.
You can upload your own custom image as the background for your video! You can drag and drop, or click to upload an image of your choosing. We recommend JPG/PNG images at
1280x720
resolution.
Ending the call
When it’s time to end the call, you can click the
Leave
button at the bottom of the screen and choose to either
End the meeting for all
which closes the meeting room for everyone, or
Leave room
which won’t close the meeting room for other participants.
You’ll be able to leave feedback on your audio and video quality during the call. We appreciate hearing how it went.

11 min readSo you’ve gone ahead and set up some
Online Appointments
, and are looking to start booking your clients in. Well, you’ve come to the right place!
Feel free to jump to one of the sections below:
Booking an Online Appointment
How to join a call
The waiting room
Settings and Features
Ending the call
If your client is having a bit of trouble connecting to the 1:1 Online Appointment from their end, we have a companion guide that you can direct them to here:
How to Join Your Online Appointment (for Clients)
.
Booking an Online Appointment
When it comes to scheduling an Online Appointment with one of your clients, the process is very similar to how you currently book a standard in-person session.
From the
Schedule
, click the date and time that you would like to book the session. When the Appointment Panel appears, choose the client (or clients) that you’ll be working with, then choose the Online Appointment type from the drop-down menu.
Next, you can add any additional details like an insurance claim or a note, before clicking the
Book Appointment
button.
Jane also has tools to offer Online Appointments for Groups of up to 12 participants. For some info on setting this up, check out
this guide
.
In addition to any normal session reminders and Thanks for Booking emails the clients receive, Jane will also send an email to the client with a direct link to join the call 30 minutes before an Online Appointment. This is the primary way for a client to join the session, so it’s good to double-check that the email address on file is correct.
💡 If you hear from clients that they haven’t received the email reminder, check the reminder is enabled and check the client’s profile to make sure they have opted in for that notification.
You can also manually trigger this link to go just prior to your online appointment by clicking on the appointment on the
Schedule
or from the
Day View
and click the blue
Re-Send Email Invitation
text on the appointment panel.
How to join a call
To get the most out of your Online Appointment, we’d recommend using the latest version of your web browser. Here are a few guides on how to update your browser:
How to update your Google Chrome browser
How to update your Safari browser
How to update your Firefox browser
How to update your Microsoft Edge browser
You can join a call by clicking on the appointment and then clicking the
Begin
button in the appointment panel. The
Begin
button will be available 1 hour before the session starts and will disappear 1 hour after the session ends.
Once you’ve clicked the
Begin
button, a new window will pop out and you may see a screen asking you to request permissions for your web browser to use your camera and microphone.
Click the blue
Request permissions
button and then we recommend choosing
Allow while visiting this site
so you won’t have to grant permissions each time you start an online appointment.
Next, you can run a quick test of your camera, microphone, speaker, and internet connection by clicking the blue
Run Test
button or you can skip the test if you prefer.
After the test screen, you can change which camera and microphone you’re using and adjust your video settings by clicking the cogwheel. You’ll have access to these settings while in the call as well.
When everything looks good, click the blue
Join meeting
button.
The waiting room
Once your client (or clients) joins the call, they’ll be in the waiting room. If you are on the call when they enter the waiting room, you’ll hear a notification chime.
You can click the blue
Let in
button to admit them or write them a quick message if you need more time.
Once you’ve let a client into the call, the timer in the upper left corner will begin and will be visible for both you and the other participants.
Settings and Features
Here are the different settings you can adjust during the call:
Hover your mouse over your camera or microphone icon to adjust your settings
Click the
Share
button to share your screen. (Please note, you can only share your screen using a laptop or desktop computer.)
Click the
People
button to see the participants. You can remove participants from this panel, or turn cameras or microphones off.
Adjusting the size of your video tile
By default, you’ll start the call in Pop out view, so you’ll see your own tile smaller than the other participants.
💡 Looking for tips on how to adjust your windows to chart during your call? Check out our guide on
Tips for Charting During Your Online Appointment
.
Gallery view
To make your tile the
same size
as the others in the call, you can turn off Pop out view by clicking the
Pop out
button on your video tile.
Hide-self view
To minimize or hide your tile, first make sure the
Pop out
option in the upper-right corner of your tile is selected. On mobile devices, you’ll find it by clicking the three dots on your tile.
Then, to hide your tile completely, hover over it and click the arrow on the left to tuck it away. You can get your tile back by clicking the arrow again.
Spotlight
If you want to make a participant’s video tile larger for everyone, you can click the
Spotlight
button in the upper-right corner of their video tile.
To remove it, just click
Spotlight off
.
Video & Audio Settings
To adjust audio or video settings, after you click on the
cogwheel icon
, you’ll want to click on
Video & Audio
within the left sidebar menu. Here you’ll have the option of selecting where the audio or video comes from. If you have an external camera or wireless headphones, here’s where you’ll want to select them.
Noise Reduction:
This toggle helps reduce the amount of background noise from your environment.
HD Video:
can be turned on if you’d prefer a higher video quality, but keep in mind you’ll want to ensure you have a strong internet connection
Widescreen Video:
Jane will automatically select a resolution based on the speed and reliability of your network, as well as the processing capabilities of your computer. We support up to 720p with 30fps at both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios.
Mirror:
Often called “self-view”, it’s a setting that controls where you appear as others see you (unmirrored) or flipped horizontally like a mirror reflection (mirrored).
General
Here, you can select the language and the skin tones for reactions.
Advanced
There are several settings here that you can adjust depending on your preferences:
Pre-call Review:
When this setting is toggled on, you and your patients will always be asked to confirm your device settings before joining the session
Low data mode/Reduce Visual Effects:
This setting is ideal if your network connection isn’t the strongest by decreasing the video resolution, disabling background effects/filters, and frame rate to prioritize audio quality.
Automatically launch picture-in-picture:
This setting in video calls allows you to see your video meeting in a small, floating window while you work in other browser tabs.
Keyboard shortcuts
: You can enable or disable the ability to for clients to use their keyboard to control certain settings within the call. Here are the shortcuts that you can use if this feature is toggled on:
V

M

Features
Chat
Click the
Chat
button to write messages or share files with your clients. To share a file while you’re in the meeting chat, you’ll want to click on the
paperclip
icon.
Timer
Want to see how long a meeting has been running for? The timer can be enabled by the practitioner by clicking on the
three dots
at the top-right and selecting
Meeting Timer.
From there, click on
Show Timer
and you’re all set!
Effects
The effects section lets you blur your background, select one of our virtual background images, or alternatively, you can upload a custom background image. This feature can be accessed directly from the
Settings
menu or when
hovering over the camera icon
from the toolbar below:
Or in the waiting room before you enter the call:
Selecting either option will open the
Effects
section of the
Settings
menu with the background options we offer.
You can upload your own custom image as the background for your video! You can drag and drop, or click to upload an image of your choosing. We recommend JPG/PNG images at
1280x720
resolution.
Ending the call
When it’s time to end the call, you can click the
Leave
button at the bottom of the screen and choose to either
End the meeting for all
which closes the meeting room for everyone, or
Leave room
which won’t close the meeting room for other participants.
You’ll be able to leave feedback on your audio and video quality during the call. We appreciate hearing how it went.Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.
