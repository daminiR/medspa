What Browsers and Devices are currently supported?
You can use your browser of choice, the most important thing is just to make sure it’s updated. Here are a few guides on how to update your browser:
How to update your Google Chrome browser
How to update your Safari browser
How to update your Firefox browser
How to update your Microsoft Edge browser
Check your internet connection at
fast.com
. You will need a result of 15Mbps or higher. If you’re seeing a number measured in Kbps, that’s not good news. If your internet connection isn’t great, you will have the option to enable low data mode or shut off the video and do an audio-only session.
📣
Heads up
: If you’re using an iPhone, iPad, or mac with
iOS 17 or macOS Sonoma
installed, then Apple’s Reactions feature is enabled on your device by default. Reactions makes emojis appear onscreen when certain hand gestures (like a thumbs up) are made by participants in a video call.
Below are instructions to disable Reactions on your device. You’ll need to disable the feature on each device you use for video calls. If your client is using an Apple device with iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma installed and they don’t want to use Reactions, they’ll need to disable it on their device as well.
On Mac:
Check to see if you’re running iOS 17 or macOS Sonoma
. If you aren’t, then you don’t need to complete the other steps until you’ve updated your device.
To disable Reactions, you need your camera to be in use. A simple way to do this is to open FaceTime and start a video call.
Click the Video button in the menu bar, and then click Reactions.
On iPhone/iPad:
Check to see if you’re running iOS 17 or macOS Sonoma
. If you aren’t, then you don’t need to complete the other steps until you’ve updated your device.
To disable Reactions, you need your camera to be in use. A simple way to do this is to open FaceTime and start a video call.
After that, swipe down from the top right corner of the screen to bring up the Control Center. (Note that if you have an iPhone/iPad with the Home Button, you will need to double-press the Home button to show the Control Center).
Now, tap on Video Effects
Finally, tap on the Reactions button to turn it off.
The button should look like this once it’s turned off:
Are Online Appointments secure and PIPEDA & HIPAA compliant?
Yes, all calls are GDPR, HIPAA, and PIPEDA compliant. To learn more, check out our
Online Appointments and Privacy Laws guide
.
Will I be able to record video, audio or chat communication?
Video, audio or chat communication
cannot be recorded
during a Online Appointment (or virtual) session. This includes if the therapist is recording themselves, but not the client. This approach ensures that this feature remains HIPAA compliant and addresses major privacy concerns around Online Appointments posed by clinics.
What is the pricing for your Online Appointments feature?
The 1:1 version of Jane’s Online Appointments is included in all pricing plans, at no extra cost.
We also have an Online Appointments for Groups feature which is available at $15 per month per practitioner. You can read more about our
Online Appointments for Groups feature here
.
Does Jane offer Online Appointments for Groups?
Yes, we do have an Online Appointments for Groups feature which is available at $15 per month per practitioner. You can read more about our
Online Appointments for Groups feature here
.
Do you know whether patients are eligible to submit insurance claims for Online Appointments for my discipline and location?
Some appointment types, depending on discipline are covered by third-party insurance payers. We would recommend checking in with your professional association OR the insurance company directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information on which appointment types are eligible for reimbursement and how to code and submit them. As you learn new info we’d love to hear about it! We will take what everyone learns and amalgamate it into a community database.
Is the consent form shown prior to the session modifiable?
The consent form that is shown prior to the session is not modifiable at this time. There may be additional consent requirements set out by your local regulatory body and we recognize the importance of ensuring that this form can be customized. Although unavailable right now, this will be something that we look to implement in a future version of this feature.
In the meantime, some clinics have set up a separate consent form under
Settings
>
Forms
>
Intake Forms
that is sent to the client prior or during the session.
💡Pro Tip: If you wanted this form to be sent out automatically to clients who book a video conference session for the first time, you could specify the Online Appointment treatments out of all your Session offerings.
Here’s how it could look in the
General tab
of your new consent form:
Then in the
Appointment Type
tab, you can select the specific session(s) you created for the Online Appointment session.
If you would like to collect this consent prior to each session, you could set the form to be triggered manually, instead. Prior to the appointment, you will be able to send off the form via the client’s profile. This would follow a very similar process to what is described in our guide on
Using Intake Forms for Consent to Treatment
.
Alternatively, a provider could read out any additional consent items required to your client during the call and document their verbal consent in a designated section of your chart note for the session.
Is the consent collected from my client prior to the session recorded somewhere in Jane?
Not at this time. As we continue to improve the consent interface for Online Appointments, we intend to make sure that these consents are documented somewhere within the Jane platform. However, you cannot join a session without confirming the consent so joining a session indicates that consent was obtained.
Please see the question above,
“Is the consent form shown prior to the session modifiable?”
, for some alternatives on collecting and documenting consent in the meantime.
Will I be required to set up a separate set of sessions to facilitate audio/video calls?
Yes, at this time we would recommend that you set up a separate set of sessions for Online Appointments.
For example, your session set-up may end up looking something like this:
In-Person Counselling Session (60-minutes)
Online Session (60-minutes)
In case it comes in handy, here is our step-by-step guide on
Setting Up Online Appointments
in your account.
Can my patients prepay for their appointment / is there a way for them to add their credit card on file online?
If you’re using
Jane Payments
, you can set an Online Booking Payment Policy. This allows you to charge for a session in full, take a deposit, or just collect credit card information when your clients book online. Your clients can also
add a credit card from their client profile
after they’ve booked online, or at any other time, through their client portal.
If you don’t have Jane Payments set up yet, don’t worry! You can still generate and download an invoice for the session to send to your client.
Here’s a helpful guide on how you get started
collecting payments for Online Appointments
with each approach.
Does the practitioner need to join the call first or can the client start the call?
Either party can join the call first. If your client joins the call first, a green badge will appear on their appointment saying, ‘Client is waiting’.
When you join the call, you’ll see a
Let in
button that you can use to let them into the call.
When your client (or clients) join the call, they can optionally test their audio, video and internet connection before entering the waiting room.
Once they enter the waiting room, they’ll see a message letting them know their practitioner will admit them shortly.
If you enter the call before your client, there will be a chime 🔔 to let you know when they have arrived. The
Admit Client
button will light up blue and you can admit them whenever you’re ready.
The call will remain open indefinitely while at least one person is on the call. Either party will be able to join the call an hour before the appointment and up to an hour after.
Where can I find the link for a client to join a session virtually?
In general, clients will receive an Appointment Reminder email 30 minutes before their scheduled appointment time. If you need to resend a link to the client so they can join the session virtually, you can head over to their appointment on the
Schedule
and click on the blue
Re-send Email Invitation
link:
Additionally, clients can join their sessions through the
My Account Patient Portal
. They’ll want to head over to
Upcoming Appointments
within the left sidebar menu and click
Begin
on the appointment.
Are there any hardware requirements for Telehealth appointments?
Each participant and the practitioner would need to be using devices with a Hardware Concurrency score of at least
4
. This relates to both your browser as well as to your computer’s CPU processing abilities.
Here’s how you can find your Hardware Concurrency Number for your device:
Right-click anywhere in an open
Chrome
window and select
Inspect
from the menu options.
Next, you can click
Console
at the top of the panel on the right. Type in
navigator.hardwareConcurrency
and hit enter. This area is case-sensitive, so you’ll want to make sure that you type it in exactly as it’s shown.
You can take note of the number displayed here. If the number is 4 or less, the device can’t support Gallery View.
Can I turn on closed captions for my telehealth sessions?
While it’s not a direct feature in Jane at the moment, you can toggle on captioning in your Chrome browser. Head over to
Chrome’s Settings
by clicking on the
three vertical black dots
.
From there, click on
Accessibility
within the left sidebar menu and then toggle on
Live Captions
:
What camera resolution is required for Telehealth appointments?
We currently don’t have a camera resolution requirement for online appointments.  For the smoothest experience, you’ll want to ensure that your internet speed is
15Mbps or higher
, and both your device and browser are up-to-date. Check out our guide on
Device & Network Recommendations
for more details.
How can I disable the Pre-Call Test that pops up before my virtual appointment?
To disable the Pre-call Test, click the
gear icon
in the upper right corner of your online appointment screen to open
Settings
.
Then select the
Advanced
tab and switch the
Pre-call review
toggle to off.
Note
📝:
Toggling off this feature disables the Pre-call Test for any future online sessions that the user joins.
Can files be shared during an online appointment?
Yes,
any session participant can attach files from their device, using a file picker or drag and drop into the chat. After you click on the
Chat
icon, you’ll want to click on the
paperclip
icon within the chat panel. Each file is presented in the chat window as an individual message and all session participants can download them. Staff members are able to delete any file shared, removing any unnecessary or incorrect files to keep the session organised.
The following file types can be uploaded:
Images
: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP
Documents
: PDF, DOCX, TXT, RTF, CSV, XLSX
Audio
: MP3, WAV
Video
: MP4, MOV, MKV, WEBM
Note
📝:
The maximum file size that can be uploaded is 15MB to maintain optimal session performance.
Can I send my own Zoom link included in the appointment reminder if I’m not using Jane’s Online Appointments feature?
Currently, there isn’t a way to change the invite link sent along to a patient if the appointment is set up as an Online Appointment in Jane. However, there is an option if you have
one shared link
for a specific session type (i.e. a series of online classes), rather than separate links for each client or appointment date and time.
A staff member with
Full Access
can head over to the
Settings
tab, click on
Sessions, Classes & Group Appointments
, and
Edit
to the right of the session.
From there, you’ll want to change the session from Online to
In-Person
to ensure the client does not receive Jane’s invitation link.
Next, scroll down to the
Details
section and add any instructions you’d like, along with a link to join the session to the
Booking Information (After Booking)
section.
Check out our
Email Customization Cheatsheet (Appointment Reminder)
guide for more details on other areas of the appointment reminder that can be customized.

What Browsers and Devices are currently supported?
You can use your browser of choice, the most important thing is just to make sure it’s updated. Here are a few guides on how to update your browser:
How to update your Google Chrome browser
How to update your Safari browser
How to update your Firefox browser
How to update your Microsoft Edge browser
Check your internet connection at
fast.com
. You will need a result of 15Mbps or higher. If you’re seeing a number measured in Kbps, that’s not good news. If your internet connection isn’t great, you will have the option to enable low data mode or shut off the video and do an audio-only session.
📣
Heads up
: If you’re using an iPhone, iPad, or mac with
iOS 17 or macOS Sonoma
installed, then Apple’s Reactions feature is enabled on your device by default. Reactions makes emojis appear onscreen when certain hand gestures (like a thumbs up) are made by participants in a video call.
Below are instructions to disable Reactions on your device. You’ll need to disable the feature on each device you use for video calls. If your client is using an Apple device with iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma installed and they don’t want to use Reactions, they’ll need to disable it on their device as well.
On Mac:
Check to see if you’re running iOS 17 or macOS Sonoma
. If you aren’t, then you don’t need to complete the other steps until you’ve updated your device.
To disable Reactions, you need your camera to be in use. A simple way to do this is to open FaceTime and start a video call.
Click the Video button in the menu bar, and then click Reactions.
On iPhone/iPad:
Check to see if you’re running iOS 17 or macOS Sonoma
. If you aren’t, then you don’t need to complete the other steps until you’ve updated your device.
To disable Reactions, you need your camera to be in use. A simple way to do this is to open FaceTime and start a video call.
After that, swipe down from the top right corner of the screen to bring up the Control Center. (Note that if you have an iPhone/iPad with the Home Button, you will need to double-press the Home button to show the Control Center).
Now, tap on Video Effects
Finally, tap on the Reactions button to turn it off.
The button should look like this once it’s turned off:
Are Online Appointments secure and PIPEDA & HIPAA compliant?
Yes, all calls are GDPR, HIPAA, and PIPEDA compliant. To learn more, check out our
Online Appointments and Privacy Laws guide
.
Will I be able to record video, audio or chat communication?
Video, audio or chat communication
cannot be recorded
during a Online Appointment (or virtual) session. This includes if the therapist is recording themselves, but not the client. This approach ensures that this feature remains HIPAA compliant and addresses major privacy concerns around Online Appointments posed by clinics.
What is the pricing for your Online Appointments feature?
The 1:1 version of Jane’s Online Appointments is included in all pricing plans, at no extra cost.
We also have an Online Appointments for Groups feature which is available at $15 per month per practitioner. You can read more about our
Online Appointments for Groups feature here
.
Does Jane offer Online Appointments for Groups?
Yes, we do have an Online Appointments for Groups feature which is available at $15 per month per practitioner. You can read more about our
Online Appointments for Groups feature here
.
Do you know whether patients are eligible to submit insurance claims for Online Appointments for my discipline and location?
Some appointment types, depending on discipline are covered by third-party insurance payers. We would recommend checking in with your professional association OR the insurance company directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information on which appointment types are eligible for reimbursement and how to code and submit them. As you learn new info we’d love to hear about it! We will take what everyone learns and amalgamate it into a community database.
Is the consent form shown prior to the session modifiable?
The consent form that is shown prior to the session is not modifiable at this time. There may be additional consent requirements set out by your local regulatory body and we recognize the importance of ensuring that this form can be customized. Although unavailable right now, this will be something that we look to implement in a future version of this feature.
In the meantime, some clinics have set up a separate consent form under
Settings
>
Forms
>
Intake Forms
that is sent to the client prior or during the session.
💡Pro Tip: If you wanted this form to be sent out automatically to clients who book a video conference session for the first time, you could specify the Online Appointment treatments out of all your Session offerings.
Here’s how it could look in the
General tab
of your new consent form:
Then in the
Appointment Type
tab, you can select the specific session(s) you created for the Online Appointment session.
If you would like to collect this consent prior to each session, you could set the form to be triggered manually, instead. Prior to the appointment, you will be able to send off the form via the client’s profile. This would follow a very similar process to what is described in our guide on
Using Intake Forms for Consent to Treatment
.
Alternatively, a provider could read out any additional consent items required to your client during the call and document their verbal consent in a designated section of your chart note for the session.
Is the consent collected from my client prior to the session recorded somewhere in Jane?
Not at this time. As we continue to improve the consent interface for Online Appointments, we intend to make sure that these consents are documented somewhere within the Jane platform. However, you cannot join a session without confirming the consent so joining a session indicates that consent was obtained.
Please see the question above,
“Is the consent form shown prior to the session modifiable?”
, for some alternatives on collecting and documenting consent in the meantime.
Will I be required to set up a separate set of sessions to facilitate audio/video calls?
Yes, at this time we would recommend that you set up a separate set of sessions for Online Appointments.
For example, your session set-up may end up looking something like this:
In-Person Counselling Session (60-minutes)
Online Session (60-minutes)
In case it comes in handy, here is our step-by-step guide on
Setting Up Online Appointments
in your account.
Can my patients prepay for their appointment / is there a way for them to add their credit card on file online?
If you’re using
Jane Payments
, you can set an Online Booking Payment Policy. This allows you to charge for a session in full, take a deposit, or just collect credit card information when your clients book online. Your clients can also
add a credit card from their client profile
after they’ve booked online, or at any other time, through their client portal.
If you don’t have Jane Payments set up yet, don’t worry! You can still generate and download an invoice for the session to send to your client.
Here’s a helpful guide on how you get started
collecting payments for Online Appointments
with each approach.
Does the practitioner need to join the call first or can the client start the call?
Either party can join the call first. If your client joins the call first, a green badge will appear on their appointment saying, ‘Client is waiting’.
When you join the call, you’ll see a
Let in
button that you can use to let them into the call.
When your client (or clients) join the call, they can optionally test their audio, video and internet connection before entering the waiting room.
Once they enter the waiting room, they’ll see a message letting them know their practitioner will admit them shortly.
If you enter the call before your client, there will be a chime 🔔 to let you know when they have arrived. The
Admit Client
button will light up blue and you can admit them whenever you’re ready.
The call will remain open indefinitely while at least one person is on the call. Either party will be able to join the call an hour before the appointment and up to an hour after.
Where can I find the link for a client to join a session virtually?
In general, clients will receive an Appointment Reminder email 30 minutes before their scheduled appointment time. If you need to resend a link to the client so they can join the session virtually, you can head over to their appointment on the
Schedule
and click on the blue
Re-send Email Invitation
link:
Additionally, clients can join their sessions through the
My Account Patient Portal
. They’ll want to head over to
Upcoming Appointments
within the left sidebar menu and click
Begin
on the appointment.
Are there any hardware requirements for Telehealth appointments?
Each participant and the practitioner would need to be using devices with a Hardware Concurrency score of at least
4
. This relates to both your browser as well as to your computer’s CPU processing abilities.
Here’s how you can find your Hardware Concurrency Number for your device:
Right-click anywhere in an open
Chrome
window and select
Inspect
from the menu options.
Next, you can click
Console
at the top of the panel on the right. Type in
navigator.hardwareConcurrency
and hit enter. This area is case-sensitive, so you’ll want to make sure that you type it in exactly as it’s shown.
You can take note of the number displayed here. If the number is 4 or less, the device can’t support Gallery View.
Can I turn on closed captions for my telehealth sessions?
While it’s not a direct feature in Jane at the moment, you can toggle on captioning in your Chrome browser. Head over to
Chrome’s Settings
by clicking on the
three vertical black dots
.
From there, click on
Accessibility
within the left sidebar menu and then toggle on
Live Captions
:
What camera resolution is required for Telehealth appointments?
We currently don’t have a camera resolution requirement for online appointments.  For the smoothest experience, you’ll want to ensure that your internet speed is
15Mbps or higher
, and both your device and browser are up-to-date. Check out our guide on
Device & Network Recommendations
for more details.
How can I disable the Pre-Call Test that pops up before my virtual appointment?
To disable the Pre-call Test, click the
gear icon
in the upper right corner of your online appointment screen to open
Settings
.
Then select the
Advanced
tab and switch the
Pre-call review
toggle to off.
Note
📝:
Toggling off this feature disables the Pre-call Test for any future online sessions that the user joins.
Can files be shared during an online appointment?
Yes,
any session participant can attach files from their device, using a file picker or drag and drop into the chat. After you click on the
Chat
icon, you’ll want to click on the
paperclip
icon within the chat panel. Each file is presented in the chat window as an individual message and all session participants can download them. Staff members are able to delete any file shared, removing any unnecessary or incorrect files to keep the session organised.
The following file types can be uploaded:
Images
: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP
Documents
: PDF, DOCX, TXT, RTF, CSV, XLSX
Audio
: MP3, WAV
Video
: MP4, MOV, MKV, WEBM
Note
📝:
The maximum file size that can be uploaded is 15MB to maintain optimal session performance.
Can I send my own Zoom link included in the appointment reminder if I’m not using Jane’s Online Appointments feature?
Currently, there isn’t a way to change the invite link sent along to a patient if the appointment is set up as an Online Appointment in Jane. However, there is an option if you have
one shared link
for a specific session type (i.e. a series of online classes), rather than separate links for each client or appointment date and time.
A staff member with
Full Access
can head over to the
Settings
tab, click on
Sessions, Classes & Group Appointments
, and
Edit
to the right of the session.
From there, you’ll want to change the session from Online to
In-Person
to ensure the client does not receive Jane’s invitation link.
Next, scroll down to the
Details
section and add any instructions you’d like, along with a link to join the session to the
Booking Information (After Booking)
section.
Check out our
Email Customization Cheatsheet (Appointment Reminder)
guide for more details on other areas of the appointment reminder that can be customized.
