Getting Started with Groups and Group Appointments
⭐ What is a Group Appointment?
A Group Appointment involves multiple clients who do know each other and are attending the session or receiving the service together. These clients are billed under a single invoice that covers the session. You can decide which client will be billed for the appointment. An example of a Group Appointment is a couples counselling session.
To learn more about Group Appointments,
take a look at our handy guide.

⭐ What’s the difference between Classes and Group Appointments?
Great question! There are a few differences between these session types:
Who are they for?
Classes
are for multiple unrelated clients, like a yoga or Pilates class.
Group Appointments
are for multiple (often related) clients joining a session together, like a Family Counselling session.
How are they scheduled?
Class
times must be scheduled administratively before clients can book online.
Group Appointment
times, however, can be chosen by clients online, just like 1:1 sessions.
Administrative scheduling
Classes and Group Appointments can be booked the same way as 1:1 visits
. Click anywhere on the schedule and then choose the Class or Group Appointment from the drop-down menu in the appointment panel.
Invoicing and taking payment
Class
participants are invoiced separately and they pay separately.
Group Appointments
have one
Primary Client
who is invoiced for the session. The invoice includes the names of
Secondary Clients
who have been arrived.
At this time, there is no option to split the bill between clients who attend a
Group Appointment
(we’re working on it though — stay tuned 😉).
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Should Group Therapy be a Class or a Group Appointment?
Contrary to what you might think, Group Therapy sessions should actually be created as a Class for two reasons:
Class participants can all be billed and invoiced separately, whereas Group Appointments can only have one payee per session.
Group Therapy sessions usually involve participants who are unrelated, and Group Appointments are intended for clients who know each other and/or are related (eg. Couples or Families).
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ What is a Group?
Groups are an
administrative shortcut
that allows you to add multiple clients or patients to a Group Appointment without having to search for their names one by one.
For more info on Groups,
check out our guide.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can clients belong to more than one Group?
You bet they can! For example, a child could belong to a Group with them and one caregiver and another Group with them and their second caregiver.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How many clients can be seen during one Group Appointment?
You’ll be able to see
up to 12 clients
during any one Group Appointment.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Do Groups affect Relationship permissions?
No, adding clients to a Group has no effect on their Relationship permissions. You could even add unrelated clients to a Group, like members of a sports team, for example.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How do I change my one-on-one appointments to Group Appointments?
While you can’t change the appointment type of your existing sessions, you can
archive your one-on-one sessions
that you’d like to replace with Group Appointments, which
will not
affect those sessions you’ve already scheduled. This removes the old sessions from your online booking page, preventing clients from booking them going forward.
Next, you can create your fresh new Group Appointment sessions and make them available for online booking.
Optionally, you can delete and rebook any one-on-one sessions that you’d like to replace with Group Appointments, but this isn’t necessary if you’d prefer to let those sessions pass on their own.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ What do I do if I’ve only been using joint profiles (for example, one client profile named “Jack and Jill Smith”)?
Great question! You’ll want to start by
Adding a new Client
for each person who will be attending sessions if you haven’t done so already. You’ll be booking these individual profiles into Group Appointments going forward.
For any chart notes stored under
joint profiles
, you can reference them on an as-needed basis or transfer them over to the individual profiles. This can be done using the duplicate/change client workflow below or by copying the chart contents from the joint profile and pasting them into the individual profiles’ chart entries. You’ll want to choose the workflow that works best for you.
For more info on making the switch from joint profiles to individual profiles,
check out our guide.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ I’m waiting for Group Billing to be released. Is there a benefit of using Groups and Group Appointments now?
Absolutely! Groups and Group Appointments are the first steps in the journey to Group Billing. Getting started now means you can hit the ground running when the next family and group-related feature is released.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How can I make sure that my group appointment is bookable online?
In the process of setting up your Group appointment, scroll down to the
Online Booking Settings
section and ensure that
Display in Online Booking
is toggled on.
This setting should automatically display the Group appointment on the online booking site. If you’re still having some trouble viewing it,
reach out to our support team
and we’ll be happy to dig into this a bit deeper 💙
🔝
Skip back to top
Scheduling
⭐ Can a client book a Group Appointment from the online booking site?
You bet they can! Clients can book their own group appointments for themselves and any related profiles they
have a relationship
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can clients change the Primary Client themselves for a Group Appointment after it has been booked?
No, this can either be done by the client by cancelling for all participants and rebooking the appointment, or a staff member can reassign the Primary administratively.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can staff change who the Primary Client is in a Group?
Yes
- the staff member can head over to the
Schedule
tab and click on the Group appointment to open up the Appointment panel.
From there, they can scroll down within the panel to the
Participants
section, click on the blue
Booked
button and select
Mark as Primary
:
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ What happens if a Primary Client cancels but leaves the Secondary Client(s) booked in the Group Appointment?
That’s no problem! A staff member will be able to reassign one of the remaining clients as the Primary.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How can I view the participants, history and status of a cancelled or deleted group appointment?
There are two different ways you can view these details:
Patient Profile
If you remember the names of the participants, you can head over to their
Profile
, click on the
Appointments
tab and then use the filters to narrow down the data to just cancelled or deleted appointments.
From there, you can click on the appointment and scroll down within the
Appointment Panel
that slides out from the right to the
History & Status
section.
Appointments Report
If you’re unsure which participants were part of the group appointment,  you can head over to the
Reports
tab, and click on
Appointments
within the left sidebar menu. From there, you’ll want to ensure the report is filtered to the correct date and appointment state (cancelled or deleted).
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ What permissions are enabled when a client adds a family member when booking a Group Appointment, and why?
When a client adds a family member or related profile, all permissions are enabled towards that client except permission to use their credit cards on file.
For example, if I add my child as a family member, I will (by default):
Receive a copy of my child’s receipts, statements, and financial emails.
Receive a copy of my child’s email notifications and reminders.
Be able to manage my child’s online bookings and complete her intake forms.
Add my child’s appointments to my calendar subscription.
The only permission that will not be enabled by default is for me to use my child’s saved credit cards.
These permissions can be edited administratively, and they’re enabled by default so that parents or other related profiles can easily manage these different areas for minors or folks who need their support.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Do I need to completely fill a Group Appointment?
Nope! You can just have one client registered, though it might make for a lonely Group Appointment.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can a staff member add multiple clients to a Group Appointment without creating a Relationship?
Yes, this can be done administratively, though a client can
only
add related profiles to a Group Appointment when booking online.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I book recurring Group appointments for the same participants?
Yes
you can! Booking a recurring appointment for a group is similar to how you would book a recurring appointment for a 1:1 appointment. You’ll first want to ensure that you have
shifts set up
or you’ll run into an error message that says
“Please select an appointment booked within a shift to add recurring appointments”
.
First, head over to the
Schedule
and select the group appointment that you’d like to make recurring. In the
Appointment Panel
, click on the
»
button to the left of the
Cancel/Delete
button:
Check out our guide on
Recurring Appointments
more detailed information.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can additional clients book into a Group Appointment on the Online Booking Site if there is already a participant in the appointment?
No, additional clients can not book a Group Appointment on your Online Booking Site if there is already at least one participant in the appointment. This is due to the nature of Group Appointments as they are intended for related clients.
For example, if you had a Group Appointment set up for family counseling, you wouldn’t want a stranger to be able to book a Group Appointment where a family member or multiple family members have already been added as participants.
For this reason, when a Group Appointment is booked online by a client, if they have linked
Client Relationship
profiles on their account, they will be prompted to select what participants they would like to book the appointment for. This will allow your clients to book multiple participants into the Group Appointment.
However, once participants are selected and the appointment is booked, Jane will remove that Group Appointment slot from the Online Booking Site so unrelated clients are not able to add themselves to the booking.
If needed, you are able to administratively add additional participants to the appointment in the Appointment panel.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can more than one staff member be added to a group appointment?
No
- at the moment there can only be one staff member per appointment type and this includes group appointments, classes and 1:1 appointments.
🔝
Skip back to top
Billing and Invoicing
⭐ Are default price Adjustments applied to Group Appointments?
Yes, under one condition. If the Primary Client has a default price Adjustment on their profile (for example, a sliding scale arrangement), then that Adjustment will be applied to the cost of their Group Appointment. Price Adjustments on Secondary Clients’ profiles will not be applied to Group Appointments.
To learn more about Adjustments,
check out our guide.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can I split the invoice for a Group Appointment?
No, a Group Appointment is associated with a single invoice that is billed to the
Primary Client
at this time.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How can cancel a group appointment and charge a no show or late cancellation fee?
While you won’t be able to use Jane’s
Late Cancellation fee
for appointments, you can still mark the
Primary
participant as
No Show
for your records and to charge them for the missed session (if applicable).
Within the
Appointment Panel
, you’ll want to click on the
No Show
button and select the specific No Show fee that you’d like to apply to the appointment.
You’ll also want to make sure that you have
No Show
fees set up over in the
Settings
tab and under
Fees
.
If you’re clinic is using Jane Payments, the outstanding balance will appear in their
My Account Patient Portal
or you can send them a
Pay Balance Email
as a reminder of the charge.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Why can’t I charge a participant after a group session?
Only the
Primary Patient
is charged for the appointment, so you’ll need to update who this is set to. To do this, head over to the appointment on the Schedule. First, click on the green
Arrived
button and mark each participant as un-arrived.
Next, click on the blue
Booked
button to the right of the participant you’d like to make the primary and select
Set as Primary Patient
from the menu options.
🔝
Skip back to top
Intake Forms and Charting for Group Appointments
⭐ Will the same Intake Form be sent to all participants for Group Appointments?
Yes! If you have a Group Appointment for families or clients with different age ranges, you might include a section on your Intake Form to be completed on behalf of a minor if applicable.
If you need separate intake forms for different age groups, we recommend sending them out manually so that you have full control over which form clients receive.
For more info on intake forms, check out
our guide here.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How do I chart for a Group Appointment?
For any new couple or related group booking, you’ll want to start by choosing a client profile to chart on.
Once you have finished charting for one of the clients in the Group Appointment, you’ll click Sign and confirm that you want to sign this chart entry.
Next, a pop-up will appear asking if you want to copy this chart to other clients. You have the option of individually selecting clients or using the Select All button for any Arrived and Not Arrived participants. When you’re ready, click Copy Entries.
This creates a copy of the signed entry in the selected participants’ profiles. You can think of this as a photocopy of a paper file, so if the original entry is changed, you will need to re-share this information across related files for a consistent paper trail.
For any chart notes stored under joint profiles, you can reference them on an as-needed basis or transfer them over to the individual profiles. This can be done using the Copy to Client feature, which you can learn more about
through our Charting for Classes & Group Appointments
guide.

Getting Started with Groups and Group Appointments
⭐ What is a Group Appointment?
A Group Appointment involves multiple clients who do know each other and are attending the session or receiving the service together. These clients are billed under a single invoice that covers the session. You can decide which client will be billed for the appointment. An example of a Group Appointment is a couples counselling session.
To learn more about Group Appointments,
take a look at our handy guide.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ What’s the difference between Classes and Group Appointments?
Great question! There are a few differences between these session types:
Who are they for?
Classes
are for multiple unrelated clients, like a yoga or Pilates class.
Group Appointments
are for multiple (often related) clients joining a session together, like a Family Counselling session.
How are they scheduled?
Class
times must be scheduled administratively before clients can book online.
Group Appointment
times, however, can be chosen by clients online, just like 1:1 sessions.
Administrative scheduling
Classes and Group Appointments can be booked the same way as 1:1 visits
. Click anywhere on the schedule and then choose the Class or Group Appointment from the drop-down menu in the appointment panel.
Invoicing and taking payment
Class
participants are invoiced separately and they pay separately.
Group Appointments
have one
Primary Client
who is invoiced for the session. The invoice includes the names of
Secondary Clients
who have been arrived.
At this time, there is no option to split the bill between clients who attend a
Group Appointment
(we’re working on it though — stay tuned 😉).
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Should Group Therapy be a Class or a Group Appointment?
Contrary to what you might think, Group Therapy sessions should actually be created as a Class for two reasons:
Class participants can all be billed and invoiced separately, whereas Group Appointments can only have one payee per session.
Group Therapy sessions usually involve participants who are unrelated, and Group Appointments are intended for clients who know each other and/or are related (eg. Couples or Families).
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ What is a Group?
Groups are an
administrative shortcut
that allows you to add multiple clients or patients to a Group Appointment without having to search for their names one by one.
For more info on Groups,
check out our guide.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can clients belong to more than one Group?
You bet they can! For example, a child could belong to a Group with them and one caregiver and another Group with them and their second caregiver.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How many clients can be seen during one Group Appointment?
You’ll be able to see
up to 12 clients
during any one Group Appointment.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Do Groups affect Relationship permissions?
No, adding clients to a Group has no effect on their Relationship permissions. You could even add unrelated clients to a Group, like members of a sports team, for example.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How do I change my one-on-one appointments to Group Appointments?
While you can’t change the appointment type of your existing sessions, you can
archive your one-on-one sessions
that you’d like to replace with Group Appointments, which
will not
affect those sessions you’ve already scheduled. This removes the old sessions from your online booking page, preventing clients from booking them going forward.
Next, you can create your fresh new Group Appointment sessions and make them available for online booking.
Optionally, you can delete and rebook any one-on-one sessions that you’d like to replace with Group Appointments, but this isn’t necessary if you’d prefer to let those sessions pass on their own.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ What do I do if I’ve only been using joint profiles (for example, one client profile named “Jack and Jill Smith”)?
Great question! You’ll want to start by
Adding a new Client
for each person who will be attending sessions if you haven’t done so already. You’ll be booking these individual profiles into Group Appointments going forward.
For any chart notes stored under
joint profiles
, you can reference them on an as-needed basis or transfer them over to the individual profiles. This can be done using the duplicate/change client workflow below or by copying the chart contents from the joint profile and pasting them into the individual profiles’ chart entries. You’ll want to choose the workflow that works best for you.
For more info on making the switch from joint profiles to individual profiles,
check out our guide.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ I’m waiting for Group Billing to be released. Is there a benefit of using Groups and Group Appointments now?
Absolutely! Groups and Group Appointments are the first steps in the journey to Group Billing. Getting started now means you can hit the ground running when the next family and group-related feature is released.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How can I make sure that my group appointment is bookable online?
In the process of setting up your Group appointment, scroll down to the
Online Booking Settings
section and ensure that
Display in Online Booking
is toggled on.
This setting should automatically display the Group appointment on the online booking site. If you’re still having some trouble viewing it,
reach out to our support team
and we’ll be happy to dig into this a bit deeper 💙
🔝
Skip back to top
Scheduling
⭐ Can a client book a Group Appointment from the online booking site?
You bet they can! Clients can book their own group appointments for themselves and any related profiles they
have a relationship
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can clients change the Primary Client themselves for a Group Appointment after it has been booked?
No, this can either be done by the client by cancelling for all participants and rebooking the appointment, or a staff member can reassign the Primary administratively.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ Can staff change who the Primary Client is in a Group?
Yes
- the staff member can head over to the
Schedule
tab and click on the Group appointment to open up the Appointment panel.
From there, they can scroll down within the panel to the
Participants
section, click on the blue
Booked
button and select
Mark as Primary
:
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ What happens if a Primary Client cancels but leaves the Secondary Client(s) booked in the Group Appointment?
That’s no problem! A staff member will be able to reassign one of the remaining clients as the Primary.
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ How can I view the participants, history and status of a cancelled or deleted group appointment?
There are two different ways you can view these details:
Patient Profile
If you remember the names of the participants, you can head over to their
Profile
, click on the
Appointments
tab and then use the filters to narrow down the data to just cancelled or deleted appointments.
From there, you can click on the appointment and scroll down within the
Appointment Panel
that slides out from the right to the
History & Status
section.
Appointments Report
If you’re unsure which participants were part of the group appointment,  you can head over to the
Reports
tab, and click on
Appointments
within the left sidebar menu. From there, you’ll want to ensure the report is filtered to the correct date and appointment state (cancelled or deleted).
🔝
Skip back to top
⭐ What permissions are enabled when a client adds a family member when booking a Group Appointment, and why?
When a client adds a family member or related profile, all permissions are enabled towards that client except permission to use their credit cards on file.
For example, if I add my child as a family member, I will (by default):
Receive a copy of my child’s receipts, statements, and financial emails.
Receive a copy of my child’s email notifications and reminders.
Be able to manage my child’s online bookings and complete her intake forms.
Add my child’s appointments to my calendar subscription.
The only permission that will not be enabled by default is for me to use my child’s saved credit cards.
These permissions can be edited administratively, and they’re enabled by default so that parents or other related profiles can easily manage these different areas for minors or folks who need their support.
🔝

⭐ Do I need to completely fill a Group Appointment?
Nope! You can just have one client registered, though it might make for a lonely Group Appointment.
🔝

⭐ Can a staff member add multiple clients to a Group Appointment without creating a Relationship?
Yes, this can be done administratively, though a client can
only
add related profiles to a Group Appointment when booking online.

⭐ Can I book recurring Group appointments for the same participants?
Yes
you can! Booking a recurring appointment for a group is similar to how you would book a recurring appointment for a 1:1 appointment. You’ll first want to ensure that you have
shifts set up
or you’ll run into an error message that says
“Please select an appointment booked within a shift to add recurring appointments”
.
First, head over to the
Schedule
and select the group appointment that you’d like to make recurring. In the
Appointment Panel
, click on the
»
button to the left of the
Cancel/Delete
button:
Check out our guide on
Recurring Appointments

⭐ Can additional clients book into a Group Appointment on the Online Booking Site if there is already a participant in the appointment?
No, additional clients can not book a Group Appointment on your Online Booking Site if there is already at least one participant in the appointment. This is due to the nature of Group Appointments as they are intended for related clients.
For example, if you had a Group Appointment set up for family counseling, you wouldn’t want a stranger to be able to book a Group Appointment where a family member or multiple family members have already been added as participants.
For this reason, when a Group Appointment is booked online by a client, if they have linked
Client Relationship
profiles on their account, they will be prompted to select what participants they would like to book the appointment for. This will allow your clients to book multiple participants into the Group Appointment.
However, once participants are selected and the appointment is booked, Jane will remove that Group Appointment slot from the Online Booking Site so unrelated clients are not able to add themselves to the booking.
If needed, you are able to administratively add additional participants to the appointment in the Appointment panel.

⭐ Can more than one staff member be added to a group appointment?
No
- at the moment there can only be one staff member per appointment type and this includes group appointments, classes and 1:1 appointments.

Billing and Invoicing
⭐ Are default price Adjustments applied to Group Appointments?
Yes, under one condition. If the Primary Client has a default price Adjustment on their profile (for example, a sliding scale arrangement), then that Adjustment will be applied to the cost of their Group Appointment. Price Adjustments on Secondary Clients’ profiles will not be applied to Group Appointments.
To learn more about Adjustments,
check out our guide.

⭐ Can I split the invoice for a Group Appointment?
No, a Group Appointment is associated with a single invoice that is billed to the
Primary Client
at this time.

⭐ How can cancel a group appointment and charge a no show or late cancellation fee?
While you won’t be able to use Jane’s
Late Cancellation fee
for appointments, you can still mark the
Primary
participant as
No Show
for your records and to charge them for the missed session (if applicable).
Within the
Appointment Panel
, you’ll want to click on the
No Show
button and select the specific No Show fee that you’d like to apply to the appointment.
You’ll also want to make sure that you have
No Show
fees set up over in the
Settings
tab and under
Fees
.
If you’re clinic is using Jane Payments, the outstanding balance will appear in their
My Account Patient Portal
or you can send them a
Pay Balance Email
as a reminder of the charge.
🔝

⭐ Why can’t I charge a participant after a group session?
Only the
Primary Patient
is charged for the appointment, so you’ll need to update who this is set to. To do this, head over to the appointment on the Schedule. First, click on the green
Arrived
button and mark each participant as un-arrived.
Next, click on the blue
Booked
button to the right of the participant you’d like to make the primary and select
Set as Primary Patient
from the menu options.

Intake Forms and Charting for Group Appointments
⭐ Will the same Intake Form be sent to all participants for Group Appointments?
Yes! If you have a Group Appointment for families or clients with different age ranges, you might include a section on your Intake Form to be completed on behalf of a minor if applicable.
If you need separate intake forms for different age groups, we recommend sending them out manually so that you have full control over which form clients receive.
For more info on intake forms, check out
our guide here.

⭐ How do I chart for a Group Appointment?
For any new couple or related group booking, you’ll want to start by choosing a client profile to chart on.
Once you have finished charting for one of the clients in the Group Appointment, you’ll click Sign and confirm that you want to sign this chart entry.
Next, a pop-up will appear asking if you want to copy this chart to other clients. You have the option of individually selecting clients or using the Select All button for any Arrived and Not Arrived participants. When you’re ready, click Copy Entries.
This creates a copy of the signed entry in the selected participants’ profiles. You can think of this as a photocopy of a paper file, so if the original entry is changed, you will need to re-share this information across related files for a consistent paper trail.
For any chart notes stored under joint profiles, you can reference them on an as-needed basis or transfer them over to the individual profiles. This can be done using the Copy to Client feature, which you can learn more about
through our Charting for Classes & Group Appointments
