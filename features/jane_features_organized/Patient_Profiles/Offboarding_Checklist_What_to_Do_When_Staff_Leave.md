Offboarding Checklist: What to Do When Staff Leave
10 min read
Practice Plan
Thrive Plan
It’s never fun when it happens, but sometimes practitioners, administrators, and business owners leave a practice.
There’s a lot to think about when it comes to making these transitions as smooth as possible, so we’ve put together an offboarding checklist to make the process a little easier. In this guide, we’ll take a look at what you can do when staff members leave your practice, and what to do if your Jane Account Owner is leaving the practice and will be transferring ownership.
Is a Staff Member Leaving?
Review Your Employment Contract
Export Data
Deactivate Their Staff Profile
Remove Their Integrations
Review Your Jane Licenses
Is the Jane Account Owner Leaving?
Updating Your Jane Subscription
Transferring Ownership
When Practitioners or Admin Staff Leave
☑ Review Your Contract and Legal Obligations
Before you get started, it can be helpful to have another look over your employment contract with the staff member. A few things to consider are if there are any obligations around:
Providing access to their data
Compensation
Continuity of client care
Retrieval of company assets
Ownership of the Jane account
Once you know what you’re each responsible for, your offboarding plan can start to take shape.
☑ Export any Data Needed
Once the staff member has finished up with their last charts and appointments, you may wish to provide them with an export of their data for record-keeping purposes.
Exporting Reports
In your
Reports
tab, you can filter reports by the staff member’s name to export
just their data
, such as in the:
Patient / Client List report
Appointments Report
Sales Report
To download and share these reports, just click the
3 dots
in the top-right of a report and choose an export option:
Note
📝:
Currently the Ratings & Reviews, Phone Reminders Due, and Return Visit Reminders Due reports cannot be exported.
Don’t forget that regular email isn’t the most secure way to share client health information, so you may wish to provide these documents using another format.
Exporting Chart Notes and Files
Practitioners can export their patient charts and files individually per patient — or, an Account Owner can receive a batch export of all charts authored by the staff member and we’ll provide them in a zip file as clearly labeled PDFs.
To get a batch export started, the Account Owner can email us at
support@janeapp.com
. For more information about this process, check out our guide
How to Request a Batch Chart Export for Staff Members
.
👉 Is your practitioner heading to another Jane clinic? In that case, you won’t need a chart export — the Account Owner can instead
securely send a copy
of all charts authored by the practitioner to another Jane account by initiating a
Jane to Jane Chart Transfer
.
☑ Deactivate their Staff Profile
Once the staff member will no longer be using the admin side of your Jane account, Account Owners and Full Access Users can
Deactivate a Staff Profile
by:
Going to the staff member’s profile in the
Staff
tab
Clicking on
Edit / Settings > Permissions & Commissions
Unchecking the
Active
box (to make their profile inactive and hidden)
And changing their Role to
No Access
Inactive vs No Access — what’s the difference?
Setting a profile to have
No Access
means they won’t be able to log into the staff side of Jane (although they could still log in as a patient, if they wanted to). On the other hand, marking a profile as
Inactive
means they won’t be able to log in as a staff member
and
they’ll be hidden from your schedule, staff list, and any reporting.
We recommend using these two settings together in case you need to temporarily reactivate a profile for reporting purposes without giving them access to your Jane account while you do it. In those cases, you can set the profile to
Active
but keep them at
No Access
.
📅 Don’t forget to
remove all future appointments
from the staff member’s Schedule before making them inactive.
Is Jane saying they have future appointments but you can’t find them? Have a peek at your
Appointments Report
and filter it for a
wide, future date range
.
☑ Remove Their Integrations and Other Access
When your staff member leaves, you’ll want to take additional steps to remove
other
types of access too, such as:
Deactivating their company email address
Changing any door or passcodes
Retrieving any physical keys and assets
And you’ll want to make sure they’re removed from any
integrations
within Jane, such as payment accounts and insurance accounts
💰 Removing their Jane Payments Account
If the staff member had a personal Jane Payments account, you’ll want to deactivate it so nobody accidentally uses it in the future and the wrong person gets paid.
To archive a Jane Payments account, a Full Access User can go to
Settings
>
Jane Payments
and click on the pencil to edit the account:
Then, you can scroll to the bottom and hit
Delete
:
Note that removing the account will also remove access to any data about this account in the
Jane Payments Reports
, so it can be a good idea to export these reports first!
🇨🇦 Removing Canadian Insurance Accounts
Was the staff member registered as an associate under your
Telus eClaims account
, or any other insurance accounts? Don’t forget to remove them from those areas, too.
You’ll want to
log into your insurance accounts directly
to remove the staff member. But once that’s done, we’ll also want to break the news to Jane by removing them from your integrations:
💚 For Telus eClaims, head into your
Settings
>
Integrations
>
Telus eClaims
section and hit the
trash can
on their provider profile:
💙 For Pacific Blue Cross, once you’ve removed them from your PROVIDERnet account directly, you’ll just want to
Reauthenticate
your integration in Jane so that you have the most recent settings:
☑ Review your Jane Licenses
Last but not least, when practitioners leave, you may need to update your Jane licenses so you’re paying for the right amount of people.
Account Owners can update their paid licenses under the
Settings
>
Jane Subscription
area by clicking
Change Subscription
and selecting a new number of licenses:
As a reminder, administrative profiles are free of charge! 🎉
Questions about your subscription? Our guide on
Managing Your Jane Subscription
is a great place to start.
If the Jane Account Owner is Leaving
In addition to the above steps, if the practice will be continuing under new ownership, the current
Account Owner
can transfer ownership of their Jane account to another staff profile.
In Jane’s eyes, the
Account Owner
is the legal custodian of data and they will be Jane’s sole point of contact for making any decisions about the account.
Not sure what Account Ownership entails or who this should be? Our guide on
Who Should Be the Jane Account Owner
can provide more context.
So then, what should a Jane Account Owner do if they’re the one leaving the practice?
☑ Update the Subscription Information
If you’ll no longer be paying for the Jane subscription, don’t forget to update the credit card on file! Account Owners can go into their
Settings
>
Jane Subscription
area and change these details in the
Update Credit Card
section:
Need to download past invoices or change the business details for future invoices? The
Billing History
tab can help with that:
For any other odds and ends, you can learn more in our guide
Managing Your Jane Subscription
.
☑ Transfer Account Ownership
When you’re ready to make the switch, your last step will be to transfer ownership of the Jane account to another active staff profile. If the new owner doesn’t have a profile yet, you can create one following these steps:
Adding New Staff Members to Jane
.
To transfer ownership of the Jane account, an Account Owner can go into the
Settings
>
Staff Permissions
area:
There, you’ll have the option to
Transfer Ownership
of the Jane account to a staff member of their choosing:
When you click
Transfer Ownership
, Jane will confirm this decision with you before making anything final. Once you click
Yes, Transfer Ownership
, Jane will make this new person the Jane Account Owner:
Please note that once you’ve transferred ownership,
this cannot be undone unless the new Account Owner transfers ownership back to you
. So just make sure you’re ready before you make the final click!
A Quick Note on Jane’s Role
We take privacy and security very seriously at Jane and we’re especially cautious when it comes to ownership of a Jane account. However,
as the data processor
,
Jane is unable to determine who the Account Owner should be
.
If you’re a Jane Account Owner and need help with any of these steps or if the current Account Owner is unable to transfer ownership due to extenuating circumstances, please email
security@jane.app
.
We hope this makes your offboarding process a little easier! But of course, if we can help with anything, we’re just a phone call away and we’d be happy to help.

Offboarding Checklist: What to Do When Staff Leave
10 min read
Practice Plan
Thrive PlanIt’s never fun when it happens, but sometimes practitioners, administrators, and business owners leave a practice.
There’s a lot to think about when it comes to making these transitions as smooth as possible, so we’ve put together an offboarding checklist to make the process a little easier. In this guide, we’ll take a look at what you can do when staff members leave your practice, and what to do if your Jane Account Owner is leaving the practice and will be transferring ownership.
Is a Staff Member Leaving?
Review Your Employment Contract
Export Data
Deactivate Their Staff Profile
Remove Their Integrations
Review Your Jane Licenses
Is the Jane Account Owner Leaving?
Updating Your Jane Subscription
Transferring Ownership
When Practitioners or Admin Staff Leave
☑ Review Your Contract and Legal Obligations
Before you get started, it can be helpful to have another look over your employment contract with the staff member. A few things to consider are if there are any obligations around:
Providing access to their data
Compensation
Continuity of client care
Retrieval of company assets
Ownership of the Jane account
Once you know what you’re each responsible for, your offboarding plan can start to take shape.
☑ Export any Data Needed
Once the staff member has finished up with their last charts and appointments, you may wish to provide them with an export of their data for record-keeping purposes.
Exporting Reports
In your
Reports
tab, you can filter reports by the staff member’s name to export
just their data
, such as in the:
Patient / Client List report
Appointments Report
Sales Report
To download and share these reports, just click the
3 dots
in the top-right of a report and choose an export option:
Note
📝:
Currently the Ratings & Reviews, Phone Reminders Due, and Return Visit Reminders Due reports cannot be exported.
Don’t forget that regular email isn’t the most secure way to share client health information, so you may wish to provide these documents using another format.
Exporting Chart Notes and Files
Practitioners can export their patient charts and files individually per patient — or, an Account Owner can receive a batch export of all charts authored by the staff member and we’ll provide them in a zip file as clearly labeled PDFs.
To get a batch export started, the Account Owner can email us at
support@janeapp.com
. For more information about this process, check out our guide
How to Request a Batch Chart Export for Staff Members
.
👉 Is your practitioner heading to another Jane clinic? In that case, you won’t need a chart export — the Account Owner can instead
securely send a copy
of all charts authored by the practitioner to another Jane account by initiating a
Jane to Jane Chart Transfer
.
☑ Deactivate their Staff Profile
Once the staff member will no longer be using the admin side of your Jane account, Account Owners and Full Access Users can
Deactivate a Staff Profile
by:
Going to the staff member’s profile in the
Staff
tab
Clicking on
Edit / Settings > Permissions & Commissions
Unchecking the
Active
box (to make their profile inactive and hidden)
And changing their Role to
No Access
Inactive vs No Access — what’s the difference?
Setting a profile to have
No Access
means they won’t be able to log into the staff side of Jane (although they could still log in as a patient, if they wanted to). On the other hand, marking a profile as
Inactive
means they won’t be able to log in as a staff member
and
they’ll be hidden from your schedule, staff list, and any reporting.
We recommend using these two settings together in case you need to temporarily reactivate a profile for reporting purposes without giving them access to your Jane account while you do it. In those cases, you can set the profile to
Active
but keep them at
No Access
.
📅 Don’t forget to
remove all future appointments
from the staff member’s Schedule before making them inactive.
Is Jane saying they have future appointments but you can’t find them? Have a peek at your
Appointments Report
and filter it for a
wide, future date range
.
☑ Remove Their Integrations and Other Access
When your staff member leaves, you’ll want to take additional steps to remove
other
types of access too, such as:
Deactivating their company email address
Changing any door or passcodes
Retrieving any physical keys and assets
And you’ll want to make sure they’re removed from any
integrations
within Jane, such as payment accounts and insurance accounts
💰 Removing their Jane Payments Account
If the staff member had a personal Jane Payments account, you’ll want to deactivate it so nobody accidentally uses it in the future and the wrong person gets paid.
To archive a Jane Payments account, a Full Access User can go to
Settings
>
Jane Payments
and click on the pencil to edit the account:
Then, you can scroll to the bottom and hit
Delete
:
Note that removing the account will also remove access to any data about this account in the
Jane Payments Reports
, so it can be a good idea to export these reports first!
🇨🇦 Removing Canadian Insurance Accounts
Was the staff member registered as an associate under your
Telus eClaims account
, or any other insurance accounts? Don’t forget to remove them from those areas, too.
You’ll want to
log into your insurance accounts directly
to remove the staff member. But once that’s done, we’ll also want to break the news to Jane by removing them from your integrations:
💚 For Telus eClaims, head into your
Settings
>
Integrations
>
Telus eClaims
section and hit the
trash can
on their provider profile:
💙 For Pacific Blue Cross, once you’ve removed them from your PROVIDERnet account directly, you’ll just want to
Reauthenticate
your integration in Jane so that you have the most recent settings:
☑ Review your Jane Licenses
Last but not least, when practitioners leave, you may need to update your Jane licenses so you’re paying for the right amount of people.
Account Owners can update their paid licenses under the
Settings
>
Jane Subscription
area by clicking
Change Subscription
and selecting a new number of licenses:
As a reminder, administrative profiles are free of charge! 🎉
Questions about your subscription? Our guide on
Managing Your Jane Subscription
is a great place to start.
If the Jane Account Owner is Leaving
In addition to the above steps, if the practice will be continuing under new ownership, the current
Account Owner
can transfer ownership of their Jane account to another staff profile.
In Jane’s eyes, the
Account Owner
is the legal custodian of data and they will be Jane’s sole point of contact for making any decisions about the account.
Not sure what Account Ownership entails or who this should be? Our guide on
Who Should Be the Jane Account Owner
can provide more context.
So then, what should a Jane Account Owner do if they’re the one leaving the practice?
☑ Update the Subscription Information
If you’ll no longer be paying for the Jane subscription, don’t forget to update the credit card on file! Account Owners can go into their
Settings
>
Jane Subscription
area and change these details in the
Update Credit Card
section:
Need to download past invoices or change the business details for future invoices? The
Billing History
tab can help with that:
For any other odds and ends, you can learn more in our guide
Managing Your Jane Subscription
.
☑ Transfer Account Ownership
When you’re ready to make the switch, your last step will be to transfer ownership of the Jane account to another active staff profile. If the new owner doesn’t have a profile yet, you can create one following these steps:
Adding New Staff Members to Jane
.
To transfer ownership of the Jane account, an Account Owner can go into the
Settings
>
Staff Permissions
area:
There, you’ll have the option to
Transfer Ownership
of the Jane account to a staff member of their choosing:
When you click
Transfer Ownership
, Jane will confirm this decision with you before making anything final. Once you click
Yes, Transfer Ownership
, Jane will make this new person the Jane Account Owner:
Please note that once you’ve transferred ownership,
this cannot be undone unless the new Account Owner transfers ownership back to you
. So just make sure you’re ready before you make the final click!
A Quick Note on Jane’s Role
We take privacy and security very seriously at Jane and we’re especially cautious when it comes to ownership of a Jane account. However,
as the data processor
,
Jane is unable to determine who the Account Owner should be
.
If you’re a Jane Account Owner and need help with any of these steps or if the current Account Owner is unable to transfer ownership due to extenuating circumstances, please email
security@jane.app
.
We hope this makes your offboarding process a little easier! But of course, if we can help with anything, we’re just a phone call away and we’d be happy to help.Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.
