Using Breaks\nYou can use the\nBreak\nfeature to block out time in your staff calendar for activities that aren’t related to client or patient appointments. This is a quick option for scheduling a day off or blocking off parts of your day.\nSome common uses for Breaks include:\nReserving a spot on your schedule for your patients without booking in an appointment (maybe the patient needs to double-check availability on their end)\nBlocking off your lunch breaks\nAdding non-billable meetings like staff meetings or training sessions to your schedule\nBooking vacation time\nAny time spent out of office\nThe list goes on!\n2. Removing Shifts\nYou can remove shifts from an individual (or multiple practitioners) schedule using the\nManage Shifts feature\n. This option is great if you need to book staff members’ holidays or vacations.\nHere’s what each option looks like in the admin schedule:\nHere’s what each option looks like in your online booking site:\nWe’ll review both options in this guide! Let’s dive in.\nInformation about Breaks\nWhen a break is on your schedule, it will appear as “Booked” in online booking. Notes on the break are only visible in the administrative side of Jane (so they will not be visible in online booking).\nFor booking breaks on a smartphone, mobile device or any small screens, review this page and then see\nthis guide doc instead\n.\nBooking a Break\nClick and release the “Break” button at the bottom left of the schedule. It will turn blue when it’s activated.\nThen, click where you want the break to start. Just clicking once will open up a “New Break” panel on the right where you can set the “end time”, or you can click and then drag on the schedule (as if you’re highlighting text) to create the length of the break in one go.  It’s okay if it’s not perfect as you’ll have a chance to edit the start and end time when you release the drag.\nThis is what the break looks like on the schedule:\nYou’ll also get a break edit screen to the right. Here you can adjust the start and end time using the drop downs, add a note so that there’s more info about the break, and choose whether it’s a repeating break or just a single break.\nIf you’re seeing this on the schedule, it means that you haven’t successfully activated the break button, and you’re still working with appointments:\nBreaks on the Schedule\nYou can use breaks in a few different ways:\nA Floating Lunch Break\nWhile a consistent break is best managed by booking multiple shifts, if you have a lunch break that might move based on when your patients want to come in, you could use a break. These breaks can be dragged to reschedule them much like appointments.\nYou’re still also able to use breaks if you’d like to label your lunch breaks on your schedule, if you prefer!\nBlock off Part of the Day\nSometimes you want the afternoon to book up first before the morning is opened up. Here’s how that might look:\nOr you’re going to the dentist:\nHolidays and Vacation Time\nIf you or your staff are taking time off, or going on vacation and holiday, you can use the break to cover the entire shift. This is a great option for all staff with access to your schedule to know why the shift isn’t available to be booked. You can also add notes, such as who might be covering that shift or that the staff member is way of vacation.\nAdministrative Notes & Meetings\nThe final reason we sometimes use Breaks in Jane is to remind staff or practitioners of administrative tasks that need to be performed. For example, if you have a team meeting coming up, staff can pop a break into their schedule to prevent any patient or client bookings.\nThen, when that staff member logs in for their day it would look like this:\nThis workflow can also be used if the clinic has non-billable meetings they’d like to block off time for, like staff meetings, interviewing new staff, or setting aside some time to call Jane if the clinic needs a hand with something 😉\nDeleting a Break\nTo delete a break on the schedule, click on it and then you will get an option to update or delete the break.  Jane will find any other break with the same start and end time and treat them as a group.\nNote - you may not have created the break as a series, but Jane will look for others that are similar\nThen you can delete or change just that one break or all of the ones listed.\n💡\nJane tip\n: You can view deleted breaks by filtering to\nBreaks\non the\nAppointments Report\n. To see a detailed history of changes, including which staff member modified a break, click the\nblue appointment link\nin the\nDate\ncolumn. This opens the Appointment Panel on the right side of the page where you can scroll to the\nHistory & Status\nsection.\nFor more info about the Appointments Report, feel free to check out this guide page:\nAppointments Report\nWell. These breaks play a lot of roles! I hope you find this helpful, and if you do have further questions feel free to get in touch.\nUse Manage Shifts to schedule staff holidays, quickly\nJane has another way for you to quickly schedule staff holidays using the\nManage Shift feature\n. Take a peek at the two scenarios below to choose the one that applies to you!\nI’d like to remove multiple shifts from one practitioner’s schedule.\nIn this case, Jane’s\nManage Shifts\ntool will get the job done faster.\nImportant first step: Select your staff member within your schedule view first.\nOpen up your\nManage Shifts\ntool,\nset the date range to the exact dates you’d like removed\n, then be sure that there are\nno shifts populating\nto the left of your Manage Shifts window. If there are, simply click the\nX\nto remove them.\nHere’s a fresh example after having removed all of my shifts to the left so that Zoey can go on holiday between\nDecember 25th and January 1st.\nI’d like to override multiple shifts from multiple practitioners’ schedules.\nImportant first step: Hover your mouse over each staff member’s name in your schedule view whose shifts you’d like to override, and click the “+” to the right to select multiple staff members.\nNow, with the Manage Shifts window open, you can select your date range in which you’d like your shift schedules removed, select your staff members from your staff list, and remove any shifts to the left. If your shift schedule is\nempty\n, then\nJane will know to remove all existing shifts within the date range you’ve chosen.\n💡\nNote\n:\nBeing the overprotective parents that we are, Jane would like to remind your clinic to be extra careful when selecting the date range here. Any shifts within this range will be removed so long as your shift schedule is empty.\nIn this example below, I am removing\nALL EXISTING SHIFTS\nfor Amy, Jonathan, and Zoey between\nDecember 25th and January 1st.\n🔴\nWarning:\nIf you see\nno Shifts populated to the left\nof your Manage Shifts window, and you proceed by clicking “\nApply Shift Schedule\n”, then you are\noverriding your existing schedule\nby\nremoving all existing shifts between this date range.\nJane will open a pop-up box that says, “\nPlease note: if you already have shifts created, continuing will override those shifts”.\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter.\nWelcome\nWelcome to the Jane Guide\nCode of Conduct\nFeature Requests\nJane's Brand Assets\nAccount Setup Consultations\nWhat's new in Jane?\nWhat's new in Jane Webinar\nJane's Changelog\nJane's Monthly Newsletter\nUpdates to Interchange Fees for Visa & Mastercard in Canada 🇨🇦\nHoward Spector joins Jane!\nJane Appoints Dan Davidow as Chief Marketing Officer\nJane App's Support Team Wins a Bronze Stevie® Award\nDemo Videos\nPractitioner's Home Base: Day Sheets & Charts\nJane in Action\nPractitioner Training:  Initial Signing In and Overview\nInsurance: Billing a Visit to a 3rd Party\nScheduling: Managing the Schedule with Many Practitioners\nDisciplines, Treatments, & Billing Settings\nSetting up Staff & Scheduling Shifts\nCharting: Signing, Duplicating & Symbols\nScheduling: Complete Schedule Overview\nBilling: Accepting Payments\nLaunching an Insurer Portal\nQuick Start\nStep 1: Clinic Information\nStep 2: Disciplines\nStep 3: Treatments\nStep 4: Staff\nStep 5: Schedule or Diary\nAdditional Set Up Recommendations\nPractitioner Step 1: Practitioner Training\nPractitioner Step 2: Treatments\nPractitioner Step 3: Shifts\nPractitioner Step 4: Online Booking\nPractitioner Step 5: Charting\nAccount Setup Consultations\nSwitching to Jane\nSwitching is easy with Jane on your team\nJane vs. SimplePractice\nAccount Basics\nHow To Check Who's Listed As Account Owner\nChecklist for Starting with Jane\nBrowser Requirements\nDevice & Network Recommendations\nUsing Jane on a Tablet\nUsing Jane on a Smartphone\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nAuto-Logout Duration\nUpdating Your Clinic Email Address & Phone Number\nLog In Help: Username and Password\nEnabling Patient Self Check-in\nAdding a Location\nBooking  a Break on a Mobile Device (Phone or other Small Screen)\nMoving Your Practice to a New Location\nMultiple Locations or Multiple Accounts: How to Set Up Jane for Independent Locations or Practitioners\nAccessibility in Jane\nI Can't Access My Jane Account: A Troubleshooting Guide\nHow to Archive a Treatment, Class or Group Appointment\nBookmarking Your Jane Account for Easy Access\nViewing Protected Financial Documents (For Patients)\nSwitching to the Balance Plan\nAdding a Billing Address for Locations\nUnauthorized Access: What to Do if Your Laptop/Phone is Lost or Stolen\nHow to Archive/Unarchive a Discipline\nHow to Change the Name of Your Clinic\nImporting to Jane\nHow to Import Data to Jane (Overview)\nBasics of Importing to Jane\nDiving Deeper Into Importing to Jane\nWhere Can You Import From?

Using Breaks\nYou can use the\nBreak\nfeature to block out time in your staff calendar for activities that aren’t related to client or patient appointments. This is a quick option for scheduling a day off or blocking off parts of your day.\nSome common uses for Breaks include:\nReserving a spot on your schedule for your patients without booking in an appointment (maybe the patient needs to double-check availability on their end)\nBlocking off your lunch breaks\nAdding non-billable meetings like staff meetings or training sessions to your schedule\nBooking vacation time\nAny time spent out of office\nThe list goes on!\n2. Removing Shifts\nYou can remove shifts from an individual (or multiple practitioners) schedule using the\nManage Shifts feature\n. This option is great if you need to book staff members’ holidays or vacations.\nHere’s what each option looks like in the admin schedule:\nHere’s what each option looks like in your online booking site:\nWe’ll review both options in this guide! Let’s dive in.\nInformation about Breaks\nWhen a break is on your schedule, it will appear as “Booked” in online booking. Notes on the break are only visible in the administrative side of Jane (so they will not be visible in online booking).\nFor booking breaks on a smartphone, mobile device or any small screens, review this page and then see\nthis guide doc instead\n.\nBooking a Break\nClick and release the “Break” button at the bottom left of the schedule. It will turn blue when it’s activated.\nThen, click where you want the break to start. Just clicking once will open up a “New Break” panel on the right where you can set the “end time”, or you can click and then drag on the schedule (as if you’re highlighting text) to create the length of the break in one go.  It’s okay if it’s not perfect as you’ll have a chance to edit the start and end time when you release the drag.\nThis is what the break looks like on the schedule:\nYou’ll also get a break edit screen to the right. Here you can adjust the start and end time using the drop downs, add a note so that there’s more info about the break, and choose whether it’s a repeating break or just a single break.\nIf you’re seeing this on the schedule, it means that you haven’t successfully activated the break button, and you’re still working with appointments:\nBreaks on the Schedule\nYou can use breaks in a few different ways:\nA Floating Lunch Break\nWhile a consistent break is best managed by booking multiple shifts, if you have a lunch break that might move based on when your patients want to come in, you could use a break. These breaks can be dragged to reschedule them much like appointments.\nYou’re still also able to use breaks if you’d like to label your lunch breaks on your schedule, if you prefer!\nBlock off Part of the Day\nSometimes you want the afternoon to book up first before the morning is opened up. Here’s how that might look:\nOr you’re going to the dentist:\nHolidays and Vacation Time\nIf you or your staff are taking time off, or going on vacation and holiday, you can use the break to cover the entire shift. This is a great option for all staff with access to your schedule to know why the shift isn’t available to be booked. You can also add notes, such as who might be covering that shift or that the staff member is way of vacation.\nAdministrative Notes & Meetings\nThe final reason we sometimes use Breaks in Jane is to remind staff or practitioners of administrative tasks that need to be performed. For example, if you have a team meeting coming up, staff can pop a break into their schedule to prevent any patient or client bookings.\nThen, when that staff member logs in for their day it would look like this:\nThis workflow can also be used if the clinic has non-billable meetings they’d like to block off time for, like staff meetings, interviewing new staff, or setting aside some time to call Jane if the clinic needs a hand with something 😉\nDeleting a Break\nTo delete a break on the schedule, click on it and then you will get an option to update or delete the break.  Jane will find any other break with the same start and end time and treat them as a group.\nNote - you may not have created the break as a series, but Jane will look for others that are similar\nThen you can delete or change just that one break or all of the ones listed.\n💡\nJane tip\n: You can view deleted breaks by filtering to\nBreaks\non the\nAppointments Report\n. To see a detailed history of changes, including which staff member modified a break, click the\nblue appointment link\nin the\nDate\ncolumn. This opens the Appointment Panel on the right side of the page where you can scroll to the\nHistory & Status\nsection.\nFor more info about the Appointments Report, feel free to check out this guide page:\nAppointments Report\nWell. These breaks play a lot of roles! I hope you find this helpful, and if you do have further questions feel free to get in touch.\nUse Manage Shifts to schedule staff holidays, quickly\nJane has another way for you to quickly schedule staff holidays using the\nManage Shift feature\n. Take a peek at the two scenarios below to choose the one that applies to you!\nI’d like to remove multiple shifts from one practitioner’s schedule.\nIn this case, Jane’s\nManage Shifts\ntool will get the job done faster.\nImportant first step: Select your staff member within your schedule view first.\nOpen up your\nManage Shifts\ntool,\nset the date range to the exact dates you’d like removed\n, then be sure that there are\nno shifts populating\nto the left of your Manage Shifts window. If there are, simply click the\nX\nto remove them.\nHere’s a fresh example after having removed all of my shifts to the left so that Zoey can go on holiday between\nDecember 25th and January 1st.\nI’d like to override multiple shifts from multiple practitioners’ schedules.\nImportant first step: Hover your mouse over each staff member’s name in your schedule view whose shifts you’d like to override, and click the “+” to the right to select multiple staff members.\nNow, with the Manage Shifts window open, you can select your date range in which you’d like your shift schedules removed, select your staff members from your staff list, and remove any shifts to the left. If your shift schedule is\nempty\n, then\nJane will know to remove all existing shifts within the date range you’ve chosen.\n💡\nNote\n:\nBeing the overprotective parents that we are, Jane would like to remind your clinic to be extra careful when selecting the date range here. Any shifts within this range will be removed so long as your shift schedule is empty.\nIn this example below, I am removing\nALL EXISTING SHIFTS\nfor Amy, Jonathan, and Zoey between\nDecember 25th and January 1st.\n🔴\nWarning:\nIf you see\nno Shifts populated to the left\nof your Manage Shifts window, and you proceed by clicking “\nApply Shift Schedule\n”, then you are\noverriding your existing schedule\nby\nremoving all existing shifts between this date range.\nJane will open a pop-up box that says, “\nPlease note: if you already have shifts created, continuing will override those shifts”.Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.\n500 - 138 13th Street East, North Vancouver\nBritish Columbia, Canada V7L 0E5\nContact Us\n+1 844-310-JANE (5263)\n+44 808 164 0893\n+61 1 800 940 893\n+1 604-670-JANE (5263)\nseejanerun@janeapp.com\nWant to keep up-to-date with everything that’s new in Jane?
