This guide to\nCustomizing Jane\n(under ‘Terminology’) tells you how you can change Jane’s default language.\nNow let’s get started on how you can add services, treatments or sessions to your Jane account. Staff members with\nFull Access\nor the\nAccount Owner\ncan create or add a new appointment type by heading over to the\nSettings\ntab and selecting\nTreatments, Classes & Group Appointments\nfrom the list on the left.\nClick the\nNew Treatment\nbutton in the top, righthand corner (or the\nEdit\nbutton next to an existing Treatment) to get started.\n💡\nJane tip\n: If you’re creating multiple treatments that are similar, check out the section below on\nduplicating treatments\nto save some time. We don’t currently have a limit on the number of treatments you can add to your Jane account at the moment.\nIf you ever decide you no longer want that Treatment in your list, you can\nArchive it\nand Jane will tuck it away for you.\nFeel free to jump to a section below:\nAppointment Type\nDiscipline and staff member\nDetails\nTreatment Colours\nOnline Booking Settings\nDuplicating a Treatment\nAppointment Type\nThe first thing you’ll need to choose is whether this appointment type is a\nOne-on-One\n,\nClass\n, or\nGroup Appointment\nusing the dropdown menu. If you choose Class or Group Appointment, you’ll be able to select the\nCapacity\n(number of participants) using the next dropdown below.\nClasses are for multiple unrelated clients, like a yoga or Pilates class. For more on Class Bookings, head here:\nClass Booking\n.\nGroup Appointments are for multiple (often related) clients joining a session together, like a Family Counselling session. To learn more about Group Appointments, head here:\nGroup Appointments\n.\nFinally, let Jane know if this is an\nIn-Person\nor\nOnline Appointment\n. If you choose Online, Jane will automatically send your client or clients a link to join the video call 1-hour before their appointment.\nJane offers\n1:1 Online Appointments\n, which are included in all accounts, and\nOnline Appointments for Groups\nas an optional paid add-on.\nDiscipline & Staff Member\nSelect the\nDiscipline\n(type of practitioner) that will be offering this Treatment.\nNext, you can choose the Staff member that will be offering it. If you select No Staff Member (Shared Treatment) then any Staff member of that Discipline will be able to choose to offer this Treatment. If you\nspecify one practitioner\n, it will only appear under their name.\nThis will affect how your Online Booking page appears to your clients and how your Staff view their Treatments in their Staff Profile.\n🖥️ Online Booking\nAvailable on the Practice and Thrive Plans\nIf you leave your Treatments as a Shared Treatment (no staff member specified), they will all appear under their Discipline heading on your Online Booking page.\nIf you specify a Staff Member for a Treatment, that Treatment will not appear under its Discipline heading on the Online Booking page. It will only be visible when a client chooses that specific practitioner.\nFor this reason, we generally recommend leaving Treatments as Shared Treatments if you use Online Booking (even if only one person offers it!)\nWhen offering online booking to your customers, you will want to know all of your options so we’ve created a handy guide to break those options down:\nChoosing What is Offered Online\n.\n🙂 Staff Profiles\nTo see this in action, head into the Staff Profile of someone in the Discipline that you created the Treatment for.\nIf you have specified them as a Staff Member on any Treatments, those will appear at the top of their\nTreatments and Classes\nlist under\nMy Treatments\n.\nIf you haven’t, you’ll only see a list of Shared Treatments that you can toggle on if they are offering that Treatment (or off if they’re not!).\nDetails\nContinuing filling in all the details you need to identify the treatment, including\nTreatment Length, Scheduled Length, Price,\nand\nIncome Category.\nYou can pick specific colours for your cash versus insurance appointments, in-person versus telehealth sessions and so on, changing how they would appear on the admin Schedule!\n❗\nPro Tip\n: You can set your Scheduled Length shorter or longer than the Treatment Length in order to allow for staggered booking or clinic-wide post-treatment breaks. You can learn more about\nSetting Up Staggered Appointments\nand\nSetting Up Post Treatment Breaks\nin our handy guides.\nThe\nDescription (Before Booking)\nis a feature designed to provide your patients with a bit more information about what they can expect for their visit before booking the appointment. This is a hardcoded setting for clinics on a\nLegacy\n,\nThrive\nor\nPractice\nplan as they have online booking features.\nTreatment Colours\nLooking to change the colour of the appointments on the administrative schedule? Here’s where to do it! Just below the\nDetails\nsection is where you get to choose the colours of your treatments. These colours are handy for differentiating the treatment types at a glance 🎨\nWe have 10 different colours to choose from:\nYou can use the same colour for multiple appointment types as well. Finding the colours hard to differentiate in your schedule? No problem. We’ve now added an accessibility mode in your schedule settings. Click on the blue View colours in accessibility mode text to preview what this looks like on the schedule:\nCheck out our guide on\nAccessibility in Jane\nto learn more about using accessibility mode in the schedule.\nThese colours are displayed on the administrative side of your Jane account only. To customize how your online booking site appears, check out our guide doc on\nBranding Your Online Booking Page\nfor more tips and tricks!\nOnline Booking Settings\nLast but not least, if you’re using Online booking, you can choose how you’d like this Treatment to be displayed for your clients.\nCall to book\nmeans that clients will be able to see the appointment availability online, but will have to call you to have you book it for them on the admin Schedule. It gives you a little bit of extra control over your Online Booking.\nDisplay price on Online Booking Pages\n: Toggle this setting on to show appointment prices to patients while booking their appointments online or off so prices aren’t displayed.\nDon’t forget to hit\nCreate Treatment\nand you’re good to go!\nDuplicating Treatments\nIf you’re adding multiple services that are pretty similar, then you can make one and duplicate it to speed up the process. This is great for treatments that share most of the same settings but just need a few tweaks, like 30, 60, and 90-minute massages, for example.\nFrom\nSettings > Treatments, Classes & Group Appointments\n, click the\nDuplicate\nbutton next to the treatment you’d like to copy.\nNext, you can make any changes to the duplicated treatment. It will have exactly the same settings as the original, except for the words “copy of” before the treatment name, which you can edit.\nOnce you’ve made your changes, just click the\nSave\nbutton.\nAdditional Notes\nDoes Jane set a maximum number of treatments or services that can be listed within the dropdown menu while booking an appointment?\nCurrently, you don’t have a set maximum on the number of treatments you can create in your Jane account, but we recommend keeping it streamlined to avoid performance issues (i.e. slow loading times).\nCan you edit treatment details at a later date?\nYes, absolutely! Sometimes you may need to update a treatment. For example, you may be rebranding session types and want to change the name of a treatment. You can do so by heading to\nSettings > Treatments > Edit\n. You can edit the name and then click\nUpdate Treatment\nto save the changes.\nIt can be helpful to note that the new treatment name will appear as the name for previously booked appointments. If you wish to keep the previous name for records, you may want to duplicate the treatment, edit the name, and then archive the past treatment.\nIf you need a hand with your treatments,\nlet us know\n, and we’ll be happy to help.\nWhy don’t I see the\nDescription(Before Booking)\noption when I view my treatment details?\nIt’s likely that your clinic is on the\nBalance plan\nand there currently isn’t a way to add that box in without upgrading your Jane account.\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter.\nWelcome\nWelcome to the Jane Guide\nCode of Conduct\nFeature Requests\nJane's Brand Assets\nAccount Setup Consultations\nWhat's new in Jane?\nWhat's new in Jane Webinar\nJane's Changelog\nJane's Monthly Newsletter\nUpdates to Interchange Fees for Visa & Mastercard in Canada 🇨🇦\nHoward Spector joins Jane!\nJane Appoints Dan Davidow as Chief Marketing Officer\nJane App's Support Team Wins a Bronze Stevie® Award\nDemo Videos\nPractitioner's Home Base: Day Sheets & Charts\nJane in Action\nPractitioner Training:  Initial Signing In and Overview\nInsurance: Billing a Visit to a 3rd Party\nScheduling: Managing the Schedule with Many Practitioners\nDisciplines, Treatments, & Billing Settings\nSetting up Staff & Scheduling Shifts\nCharting: Signing, Duplicating & Symbols\nScheduling: Complete Schedule Overview\nBilling: Accepting Payments\nLaunching an Insurer Portal\nQuick Start\nStep 1: Clinic Information\nStep 2: Disciplines\nStep 3: Treatments\nStep 4: Staff\nStep 5: Schedule or Diary\nAdditional Set Up Recommendations\nPractitioner Step 1: Practitioner Training\nPractitioner Step 2: Treatments\nPractitioner Step 3: Shifts\nPractitioner Step 4: Online Booking\nPractitioner Step 5: Charting\nAccount Setup Consultations\nSwitching to Jane\nSwitching is easy with Jane on your team\nJane vs. SimplePractice\nAccount Basics\nHow To Check Who's Listed As Account Owner\nChecklist for Starting with Jane\nBrowser Requirements\nDevice & Network Recommendations\nUsing Jane on a Tablet\nUsing Jane on a Smartphone\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nAuto-Logout Duration\nUpdating Your Clinic Email Address & Phone Number\nLog In Help: Username and Password\nEnabling Patient Self Check-in\nAdding a Location\nBooking  a Break on a Mobile Device (Phone or other Small Screen)\nMoving Your Practice to a New Location\nMultiple Locations or Multiple Accounts: How to Set Up Jane for Independent Locations or Practitioners\nAccessibility in Jane\nI Can't Access My Jane Account: A Troubleshooting Guide\nHow to Archive a Treatment, Class or Group Appointment\nBookmarking Your Jane Account for Easy Access\nViewing Protected Financial Documents (For Patients)\nSwitching to the Balance Plan\nAdding a Billing Address for Locations\nUnauthorized Access: What to Do if Your Laptop/Phone is Lost or Stolen\nHow to Archive/Unarchive a Discipline\nHow to Change the Name of Your Clinic\nImporting to Jane\nHow to Import Data to Jane (Overview)\nBasics of Importing to Jane\nDiving Deeper Into Importing to Jane\nWhere Can You Import From?

This guide to\nCustomizing Jane\n(under ‘Terminology’) tells you how you can change Jane’s default language.\nNow let’s get started on how you can add services, treatments or sessions to your Jane account. Staff members with\nFull Access\nor the\nAccount Owner\ncan create or add a new appointment type by heading over to the\nSettings\ntab and selecting\nTreatments, Classes & Group Appointments\nfrom the list on the left.\nClick the\nNew Treatment\nbutton in the top, righthand corner (or the\nEdit\nbutton next to an existing Treatment) to get started.\n💡\nJane tip\n: If you’re creating multiple treatments that are similar, check out the section below on\nduplicating treatments\nto save some time. We don’t currently have a limit on the number of treatments you can add to your Jane account at the moment.\nIf you ever decide you no longer want that Treatment in your list, you can\nArchive it\nand Jane will tuck it away for you.\nFeel free to jump to a section below:\nAppointment Type\nDiscipline and staff member\nDetails\nTreatment Colours\nOnline Booking Settings\nDuplicating a Treatment\nAppointment Type\nThe first thing you’ll need to choose is whether this appointment type is a\nOne-on-One\n,\nClass\n, or\nGroup Appointment\nusing the dropdown menu. If you choose Class or Group Appointment, you’ll be able to select the\nCapacity\n(number of participants) using the next dropdown below.\nClasses are for multiple unrelated clients, like a yoga or Pilates class. For more on Class Bookings, head here:\nClass Booking\n.\nGroup Appointments are for multiple (often related) clients joining a session together, like a Family Counselling session. To learn more about Group Appointments, head here:\nGroup Appointments\n.\nFinally, let Jane know if this is an\nIn-Person\nor\nOnline Appointment\n. If you choose Online, Jane will automatically send your client or clients a link to join the video call 1-hour before their appointment.\nJane offers\n1:1 Online Appointments\n, which are included in all accounts, and\nOnline Appointments for Groups\nas an optional paid add-on.\nDiscipline & Staff Member\nSelect the\nDiscipline\n(type of practitioner) that will be offering this Treatment.\nNext, you can choose the Staff member that will be offering it. If you select No Staff Member (Shared Treatment) then any Staff member of that Discipline will be able to choose to offer this Treatment. If you\nspecify one practitioner\n, it will only appear under their name.\nThis will affect how your Online Booking page appears to your clients and how your Staff view their Treatments in their Staff Profile.\n🖥️ Online Booking\nAvailable on the Practice and Thrive Plans\nIf you leave your Treatments as a Shared Treatment (no staff member specified), they will all appear under their Discipline heading on your Online Booking page.\nIf you specify a Staff Member for a Treatment, that Treatment will not appear under its Discipline heading on the Online Booking page. It will only be visible when a client chooses that specific practitioner.\nFor this reason, we generally recommend leaving Treatments as Shared Treatments if you use Online Booking (even if only one person offers it!)\nWhen offering online booking to your customers, you will want to know all of your options so we’ve created a handy guide to break those options down:\nChoosing What is Offered Online\n.\n🙂 Staff Profiles\nTo see this in action, head into the Staff Profile of someone in the Discipline that you created the Treatment for.\nIf you have specified them as a Staff Member on any Treatments, those will appear at the top of their\nTreatments and Classes\nlist under\nMy Treatments\n.\nIf you haven’t, you’ll only see a list of Shared Treatments that you can toggle on if they are offering that Treatment (or off if they’re not!).\nDetails\nContinuing filling in all the details you need to identify the treatment, including\nTreatment Length, Scheduled Length, Price,\nand\nIncome Category.\nYou can pick specific colours for your cash versus insurance appointments, in-person versus telehealth sessions and so on, changing how they would appear on the admin Schedule!\n❗\nPro Tip\n: You can set your Scheduled Length shorter or longer than the Treatment Length in order to allow for staggered booking or clinic-wide post-treatment breaks. You can learn more about\nSetting Up Staggered Appointments\nand\nSetting Up Post Treatment Breaks\nin our handy guides.\nThe\nDescription (Before Booking)\nis a feature designed to provide your patients with a bit more information about what they can expect for their visit before booking the appointment. This is a hardcoded setting for clinics on a\nLegacy\n,\nThrive\nor\nPractice\nplan as they have online booking features.\nTreatment Colours\nLooking to change the colour of the appointments on the administrative schedule? Here’s where to do it! Just below the\nDetails\nsection is where you get to choose the colours of your treatments. These colours are handy for differentiating the treatment types at a glance 🎨\nWe have 10 different colours to choose from:\nYou can use the same colour for multiple appointment types as well. Finding the colours hard to differentiate in your schedule? No problem. We’ve now added an accessibility mode in your schedule settings. Click on the blue View colours in accessibility mode text to preview what this looks like on the schedule:\nCheck out our guide on\nAccessibility in Jane\nto learn more about using accessibility mode in the schedule.\nThese colours are displayed on the administrative side of your Jane account only. To customize how your online booking site appears, check out our guide doc on\nBranding Your Online Booking Page\nfor more tips and tricks!\nOnline Booking Settings\nLast but not least, if you’re using Online booking, you can choose how you’d like this Treatment to be displayed for your clients.\nCall to book\nmeans that clients will be able to see the appointment availability online, but will have to call you to have you book it for them on the admin Schedule. It gives you a little bit of extra control over your Online Booking.\nDisplay price on Online Booking Pages\n: Toggle this setting on to show appointment prices to patients while booking their appointments online or off so prices aren’t displayed.\nDon’t forget to hit\nCreate Treatment\nand you’re good to go!\nDuplicating Treatments\nIf you’re adding multiple services that are pretty similar, then you can make one and duplicate it to speed up the process. This is great for treatments that share most of the same settings but just need a few tweaks, like 30, 60, and 90-minute massages, for example.\nFrom\nSettings > Treatments, Classes & Group Appointments\n, click the\nDuplicate\nbutton next to the treatment you’d like to copy.\nNext, you can make any changes to the duplicated treatment. It will have exactly the same settings as the original, except for the words “copy of” before the treatment name, which you can edit.\nOnce you’ve made your changes, just click the\nSave\nbutton.\nAdditional Notes\nDoes Jane set a maximum number of treatments or services that can be listed within the dropdown menu while booking an appointment?\nCurrently, you don’t have a set maximum on the number of treatments you can create in your Jane account, but we recommend keeping it streamlined to avoid performance issues (i.e. slow loading times).\nCan you edit treatment details at a later date?\nYes, absolutely! Sometimes you may need to update a treatment. For example, you may be rebranding session types and want to change the name of a treatment. You can do so by heading to\nSettings > Treatments > Edit\n. You can edit the name and then click\nUpdate Treatment\nto save the changes.\nIt can be helpful to note that the new treatment name will appear as the name for previously booked appointments. If you wish to keep the previous name for records, you may want to duplicate the treatment, edit the name, and then archive the past treatment.\nIf you need a hand with your treatments,\nlet us know\n, and we’ll be happy to help.\nWhy don’t I see the\nDescription(Before Booking)\noption when I view my treatment details?\nIt’s likely that your clinic is on the\nBalance plan\nand there currently isn’t a way to add that box in without upgrading your Jane account.Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.\n500 - 138 13th Street East, North Vancouver\nBritish Columbia, Canada V7L 0E5\nContact Us\n+1 844-310-JANE (5263)\n+44 808 164 0893\n+61 1 800 940 893\n+1 604-670-JANE (5263)\nseejanerun@janeapp.com\nWant to keep up-to-date with everything that’s new in Jane?
