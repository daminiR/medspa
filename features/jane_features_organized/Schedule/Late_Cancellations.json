If you don’t see what you’re looking for here, please don’t hesitate to\nget in touch with us\n.\nHere’s what we’ll be covering in this guide:\nSet Up\nSetting up Late Cancellation fees\n(Optional)\nUpdating your fees if you were using No Shows for Late Cancellations\nLate Cancelling and invoicing an appointment\nLate Cancelling an appointment\nEmailing the client their invoice for the Late Cancellation fee\nCollecting payment for the Late Cancellation fee\nRemoving a Late Cancellation\nFAQ & Feedback 💙\nLet’s dive in!\nSetting up Late Cancellation fees\nYou’ll want to start by setting up your Late Cancellation fees. This can be a percentage of the treatment price or a flat amount.\nFirst, head to\nSettings\non the top bar of Jane and select\nFees\nfrom the\nBilling\nsection:\nYou’ll see all of the No Show fees you’ve previously set up listed here. Click\nNew Fee\nin the upper right corner:\nNext, you’ll enter the details of your Late Cancellation fee.\nName\n: Start by naming the fee. Please note, this name will be visible on a client’s invoice.\n💡 Jane tip: We highly recommend naming your fee “\nLate Cancellation - [Fee amount]\n” so that you will have no trouble choosing the right fee from the cancellation fee options.\nFee Type\n: For the Fee Type, you’ll want to choose\nLate Cancellation\n. (If you’re looking to set up your\nNo Show Fees\n, you can\nclick on this guide to learn more\n.)\nAdjustment Type\n: Just like when you create a price adjustment, you have three options to choose from:\nOverride\n: Use this if you would like to charge a flat rate for a late cancellation, regardless of the appointment cost.\nPercentage Discount\n: Use this if you would like to charge a percentage of the appointment cost, for example, 50%.\nDollar discount\n: This option lets you add or subtract an amount from the total cost of the appointment. Here are two ways it can be used:\nCharging the total cost of the visit\n: If we set the dollar discount to 0.00, it means that we are neither adding or subtracting an amount from the original cost of the appointment, so the client will be charged the full cost of the appointment with no adjustments.\nCharging the full cost of the appointment plus an administrative fee\n: Let’s say that for a late cancellation, we charge the full cost of the appointment plus a 25$ administrative fee. In this case, what we choose as the value of our dollar discount will be subtracted from the full cost of the appointment. In order to\nadd\nan amount (instead of subtracting one), we will need to enter a negative number into the\nValue\nfield. In this case, we will enter -25 as the\nValue\nof our dollar discount. Here’s how this looks:\nValue\n: This is where you enter either the flat rate you’d like to charge, the percentage discount, or the dollar discount.\nProvider of Discount:\nIf you’re using a percentage-based compensation for your staff, this option tells Jane whether you’d like the staff member to be compensated based on the original cost of the appointment, or based on the cost of the cancellation fee.\nClinic & Staff Member:\nStaff member is compensated based on the cost of the cancellation fee.\nClinic Only:\nStaff member is compensated based on the original cost of the appointment.\nOnce you have filled out these fields, click the blue\nCreate Fee\nbutton in the lower right-hand corner:\nPro Tip\n: You can repeat this process to create as many different fee options as you like. You may wish to have one with an override of $0.00 in a case where you want to track the late cancellation but do not want to charge the client for the appointment.\n(Optional)\nUpdating your fees if you were using No Shows for Late Cancellations\nBefore we had the Late Cancellation feature, we recommended creating No Show fees so that clients could be charged a fee for a cancellation without enough notice.\nIf you’ve created No Show fees that you would like to change to Late Cancellation fees, here’s how you can edit them.\nYou’ll head to\nSettings\non the top bar of Jane, and select\nFees\non the menu to the left:\nNext, you can click\nEdit\nnext to any No Show fee that you’d like to change into a Late Cancellation fee:\nThen you can choose Late Cancellation as the fee type, and click\nUpdate Fee:\nLate Cancelling an appointment\nWhether you’re charging the client for the missed appointment or not, you’ll be able to mark this appointment as a late cancellation from the\nSchedule\ntab. From there,\nclick on the appointment\nand then select the\nCancel/Delete\nbutton on the appointment panel to the right.\nNext, you’ll choose which\nLate Cancellation\nfee you’d like to use:\nA pop-up will appear where you can choose your cancellation reason from the list we created in the previous section of this guide, or you can create a custom reason by selecting\nOther Reason:\nLet’s move on to emailing the client their invoice and collecting payment for the Late Cancellation fee.\nEmailing the client their invoice for the Late Cancellation fee\nTo send a client their outstanding invoice, start by clicking on their appointment either from the schedule or the client’s Appointments tab in their profile. Scroll down the appointment panel to the\nBilling Info\nsection and click on the blue\ninvoice:\nThen you’ll click the\nEmail\nbutton in the upper-right of this page to send off their invoice.\nCollecting Payment for a Late Cancellation fee\nPay Balance Emails and Texts\nJane Payments\nusers can send a Pay Balance Email or Text to a client from their profile which will prompt them for the total amount of any outstanding invoices:\nFor more information on Pay Balance Emails and Texts, you can check out our guide on\nPaying Balances Online\n.\nCollecting payment administratively\nIf you’re collecting payment administratively, start by clicking on the client’s appointment either from the schedule or the client’s\nAppointments\ntab in their profile.\nNext, you can scroll down and hover your mouse over the\nBilling Info\nsection of the appointment panel to the right and click the blue\nView\nbutton:\nFrom here, click the blue\nPay\nbutton in the upper-right corner of this page and go through the\nregular payment workflow\n.\nRemoving a Late Cancellation\nIf you cancelled an appointment by accident, or the client changed their mind, not to worry! You can easily uncancel the appointment.\nThis can be done in a couple of different ways, but if you’re on the\nSchedule\ntab, you can adjust the\nSchedule View Settings\nto ensure that the\nCancelled\nfilter is\ntoggled on\n.\nNow click on the cancelled appointment that appears on the schedule and within the\nAppointment Panel\nyou can click on\nUncancel\n.\nThis will bring the appointment back on to the schedule and get rid of the Late Cancellation Invoice. The last step here would be to\ndelete the appointment\nif it was created in error or mark it as\nArrived\nif the patient was just running a bit late.\nNote📝\n:\nWhen you cancel an appointment, the client receives a cancellation notification 3 minutes later. If you uncancel a cancelled visit before the 3-minute mark, the cancellation notification will not be sent.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhy can’t I see an appointment on the schedule after I’ve cancelled it?\nCan clients late cancel their own appointments?\nWhy don’t I see my late cancellation fees show up as an option when I click the cancel/delete button?\nCan I see my Late Cancellations on a report?\nDo clients get a separate email for late cancellations?\nIf I uncancel an appointment, will the client receive a notification?\nCan I change the late cancellation fee without having to undo the cancellation?\nHow can I remove tax from a late cancellation?\nFeedback and Feature Requests\nWhy can’t I see an appointment on the schedule after I’ve cancelled it?\nThis likely has to do with your schedule settings. To change whether or not you want to see cancelled appointments on the schedule, you can click on the cogwheel in the lower right corner of the schedule:\nYou’ll see a list of appointment types and you can toggle them on if you want to see them on the schedule, or off if you want to hide them from the schedule:\nPro Tip\n: Some folks prefer to keep cancelled appointments toggled off so that they can easily book a different client into a cancelled time slot.\nCan clients late cancel their own appointments?\nNo— right now, clients can only cancel their own visits online if they are not within the late cancellation period. If this is a feature you’re interested in, we’d love for you to add your vote and comments to\nthis feature request\n.\nWhy don’t I see my late cancellation fees show up as an option when I click the cancel/delete button?\nGood question! If you’ve set up your Late Cancellation Fees already, but don’t see them when you click the\nCancel/Delete\nbutton on the appointment panel, then you’ll want to make sure you are within the late cancellation period.\nFor example, if you require 24-hours notice for cancellations, then Jane won’t show you your Late Cancellation Fees on an appointment that’s more than 24 hours in the future.\nCan I see my Late Cancellations on a report?\nAll cancellations, late or otherwise, will show up on the\nAppointment Report\nwhen we filter the appointment state to display\ncancelled\nvisits.\nWe do not currently have a filter to separate out Late Cancellations from other cancellations, but if you view an individual client’s profile, you’ll see that any cancelled appointment with an invoice is a Late Cancellation:\nJane Tip:\nThere are two differences between a Late Cancellation and a regular cancellation. A Late Cancellation can only be done administratively and has an invoice associated with the appointment, while a regular cancellation can be done by a client or administratively, and has no associated invoice.\nDo clients get a separate email for late cancellations?\nNo, if a client’s appointment is cancelled (regardless of when the cancellation occurs) and the cancellation is not reversed in 3 minutes, the client will receive the regular cancellation notification email.\nTo preview what the cancellation email looks like in your account, head to\nSettings\n>\n**select **Emails\n> choose\nAppointment Cancelled Notification\nfrom the drop-down menu.\nIf I uncancel an appointment, will the client receive a notification?\nIt depends on when you uncancel the appointment. If you cancel an appointment and then uncancel it within 3 minutes, a notification\nwill not\nbe sent.\nIf you uncancel an appointment more than 3 minutes after the appointment was cancelled, the client\nwill\nreceive the cancellation notification. They will not receive a notification that the cancellation has been undone.\nCan I change the late cancellation fee without having to undo the cancellation?\nAbsolutely! Once you’ve chosen the Late Cancellation Fee from the appointment panel, you can change it by\nclicking on the name or amount of the fee\nin the\nBilling Info\nsection of the appointment panel:\nA pop-up will appear where you can edit the type of adjustment, the amount, and whether or not the staff member is compensated based on the adjusted price or the original appointment price. Don’t forget to hit\nSave\nwhen you’re done!\nHow can I remove tax from a late cancellation?\nHead over to the patient’s profile, click\nBilling\nand under\nPurchases\n, click\nView\nto the right of the invoice.\nNow you can uncheck the\nThis purchase is taxable\nsetting.\nFeedback and Feature Requests\nHere are a few Feature Requests we think many of you might have. We’d love it if you’d add your feedback by clicking on the links below so we can use it as we think about how to continue building on this feature:\nI want Jane to automatically email my client their Late Cancellation Invoice\nI want to filter a report to show only my Late Cancellations\nI want clients to be able to late cancel their own appointment through their My Account portal.\nI’d like to make a new Feature Request.\nIs there something else you think would make a helpful addition to this feature?

If you don’t see what you’re looking for here, please don’t hesitate to\nget in touch with us\n.\nHere’s what we’ll be covering in this guide:\nSet Up\nSetting up Late Cancellation fees\n(Optional)\nUpdating your fees if you were using No Shows for Late Cancellations\nLate Cancelling and invoicing an appointment\nLate Cancelling an appointment\nEmailing the client their invoice for the Late Cancellation fee\nCollecting payment for the Late Cancellation fee\nRemoving a Late Cancellation\nFAQ & Feedback 💙\nLet’s dive in!\nSetting up Late Cancellation fees\nYou’ll want to start by setting up your Late Cancellation fees. This can be a percentage of the treatment price or a flat amount.\nFirst, head to\nSettings\non the top bar of Jane and select\nFees\nfrom the\nBilling\nsection:\nYou’ll see all of the No Show fees you’ve previously set up listed here. Click\nNew Fee\nin the upper right corner:\nNext, you’ll enter the details of your Late Cancellation fee.\nName\n: Start by naming the fee. Please note, this name will be visible on a client’s invoice.\n💡 Jane tip: We highly recommend naming your fee “\nLate Cancellation - [Fee amount]\n” so that you will have no trouble choosing the right fee from the cancellation fee options.\nFee Type\n: For the Fee Type, you’ll want to choose\nLate Cancellation\n. (If you’re looking to set up your\nNo Show Fees\n, you can\nclick on this guide to learn more\n.)\nAdjustment Type\n: Just like when you create a price adjustment, you have three options to choose from:\nOverride\n: Use this if you would like to charge a flat rate for a late cancellation, regardless of the appointment cost.\nPercentage Discount\n: Use this if you would like to charge a percentage of the appointment cost, for example, 50%.\nDollar discount\n: This option lets you add or subtract an amount from the total cost of the appointment. Here are two ways it can be used:\nCharging the total cost of the visit\n: If we set the dollar discount to 0.00, it means that we are neither adding or subtracting an amount from the original cost of the appointment, so the client will be charged the full cost of the appointment with no adjustments.\nCharging the full cost of the appointment plus an administrative fee\n: Let’s say that for a late cancellation, we charge the full cost of the appointment plus a 25$ administrative fee. In this case, what we choose as the value of our dollar discount will be subtracted from the full cost of the appointment. In order to\nadd\nan amount (instead of subtracting one), we will need to enter a negative number into the\nValue\nfield. In this case, we will enter -25 as the\nValue\nof our dollar discount. Here’s how this looks:\nValue\n: This is where you enter either the flat rate you’d like to charge, the percentage discount, or the dollar discount.\nProvider of Discount:\nIf you’re using a percentage-based compensation for your staff, this option tells Jane whether you’d like the staff member to be compensated based on the original cost of the appointment, or based on the cost of the cancellation fee.\nClinic & Staff Member:\nStaff member is compensated based on the cost of the cancellation fee.\nClinic Only:\nStaff member is compensated based on the original cost of the appointment.\nOnce you have filled out these fields, click the blue\nCreate Fee\nbutton in the lower right-hand corner:\nPro Tip\n: You can repeat this process to create as many different fee options as you like. You may wish to have one with an override of $0.00 in a case where you want to track the late cancellation but do not want to charge the client for the appointment.\n(Optional)\nUpdating your fees if you were using No Shows for Late Cancellations\nBefore we had the Late Cancellation feature, we recommended creating No Show fees so that clients could be charged a fee for a cancellation without enough notice.\nIf you’ve created No Show fees that you would like to change to Late Cancellation fees, here’s how you can edit them.\nYou’ll head to\nSettings\non the top bar of Jane, and select\nFees\non the menu to the left:\nNext, you can click\nEdit\nnext to any No Show fee that you’d like to change into a Late Cancellation fee:\nThen you can choose Late Cancellation as the fee type, and click\nUpdate Fee:\nLate Cancelling an appointment\nWhether you’re charging the client for the missed appointment or not, you’ll be able to mark this appointment as a late cancellation from the\nSchedule\ntab. From there,\nclick on the appointment\nand then select the\nCancel/Delete\nbutton on the appointment panel to the right.\nNext, you’ll choose which\nLate Cancellation\nfee you’d like to use:\nA pop-up will appear where you can choose your cancellation reason from the list we created in the previous section of this guide, or you can create a custom reason by selecting\nOther Reason:\nLet’s move on to emailing the client their invoice and collecting payment for the Late Cancellation fee.\nEmailing the client their invoice for the Late Cancellation fee\nTo send a client their outstanding invoice, start by clicking on their appointment either from the schedule or the client’s Appointments tab in their profile. Scroll down the appointment panel to the\nBilling Info\nsection and click on the blue\ninvoice:\nThen you’ll click the\nEmail\nbutton in the upper-right of this page to send off their invoice.\nCollecting Payment for a Late Cancellation fee\nPay Balance Emails and Texts\nJane Payments\nusers can send a Pay Balance Email or Text to a client from their profile which will prompt them for the total amount of any outstanding invoices:\nFor more information on Pay Balance Emails and Texts, you can check out our guide on\nPaying Balances Online\n.\nCollecting payment administratively\nIf you’re collecting payment administratively, start by clicking on the client’s appointment either from the schedule or the client’s\nAppointments\ntab in their profile.\nNext, you can scroll down and hover your mouse over the\nBilling Info\nsection of the appointment panel to the right and click the blue\nView\nbutton:\nFrom here, click the blue\nPay\nbutton in the upper-right corner of this page and go through the\nregular payment workflow\n.\nRemoving a Late Cancellation\nIf you cancelled an appointment by accident, or the client changed their mind, not to worry! You can easily uncancel the appointment.\nThis can be done in a couple of different ways, but if you’re on the\nSchedule\ntab, you can adjust the\nSchedule View Settings\nto ensure that the\nCancelled\nfilter is\ntoggled on\n.\nNow click on the cancelled appointment that appears on the schedule and within the\nAppointment Panel\nyou can click on\nUncancel\n.\nThis will bring the appointment back on to the schedule and get rid of the Late Cancellation Invoice. The last step here would be to\ndelete the appointment\nif it was created in error or mark it as\nArrived\nif the patient was just running a bit late.\nNote📝\n:\nWhen you cancel an appointment, the client receives a cancellation notification 3 minutes later. If you uncancel a cancelled visit before the 3-minute mark, the cancellation notification will not be sent.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhy can’t I see an appointment on the schedule after I’ve cancelled it?\nCan clients late cancel their own appointments?\nWhy don’t I see my late cancellation fees show up as an option when I click the cancel/delete button?\nCan I see my Late Cancellations on a report?\nDo clients get a separate email for late cancellations?\nIf I uncancel an appointment, will the client receive a notification?\nCan I change the late cancellation fee without having to undo the cancellation?\nHow can I remove tax from a late cancellation?\nFeedback and Feature Requests\nWhy can’t I see an appointment on the schedule after I’ve cancelled it?\nThis likely has to do with your schedule settings. To change whether or not you want to see cancelled appointments on the schedule, you can click on the cogwheel in the lower right corner of the schedule:\nYou’ll see a list of appointment types and you can toggle them on if you want to see them on the schedule, or off if you want to hide them from the schedule:\nPro Tip\n: Some folks prefer to keep cancelled appointments toggled off so that they can easily book a different client into a cancelled time slot.\nCan clients late cancel their own appointments?\nNo— right now, clients can only cancel their own visits online if they are not within the late cancellation period. If this is a feature you’re interested in, we’d love for you to add your vote and comments to\nthis feature request\n.\nWhy don’t I see my late cancellation fees show up as an option when I click the cancel/delete button?\nGood question! If you’ve set up your Late Cancellation Fees already, but don’t see them when you click the\nCancel/Delete\nbutton on the appointment panel, then you’ll want to make sure you are within the late cancellation period.\nFor example, if you require 24-hours notice for cancellations, then Jane won’t show you your Late Cancellation Fees on an appointment that’s more than 24 hours in the future.\nCan I see my Late Cancellations on a report?\nAll cancellations, late or otherwise, will show up on the\nAppointment Report\nwhen we filter the appointment state to display\ncancelled\nvisits.\nWe do not currently have a filter to separate out Late Cancellations from other cancellations, but if you view an individual client’s profile, you’ll see that any cancelled appointment with an invoice is a Late Cancellation:\nJane Tip:\nThere are two differences between a Late Cancellation and a regular cancellation. A Late Cancellation can only be done administratively and has an invoice associated with the appointment, while a regular cancellation can be done by a client or administratively, and has no associated invoice.\nDo clients get a separate email for late cancellations?\nNo, if a client’s appointment is cancelled (regardless of when the cancellation occurs) and the cancellation is not reversed in 3 minutes, the client will receive the regular cancellation notification email.\nTo preview what the cancellation email looks like in your account, head to\nSettings\n>\n**select **Emails\n> choose\nAppointment Cancelled Notification\nfrom the drop-down menu.\nIf I uncancel an appointment, will the client receive a notification?\nIt depends on when you uncancel the appointment. If you cancel an appointment and then uncancel it within 3 minutes, a notification\nwill not\nbe sent.\nIf you uncancel an appointment more than 3 minutes after the appointment was cancelled, the client\nwill\nreceive the cancellation notification. They will not receive a notification that the cancellation has been undone.\nCan I change the late cancellation fee without having to undo the cancellation?\nAbsolutely! Once you’ve chosen the Late Cancellation Fee from the appointment panel, you can change it by\nclicking on the name or amount of the fee\nin the\nBilling Info\nsection of the appointment panel:\nA pop-up will appear where you can edit the type of adjustment, the amount, and whether or not the staff member is compensated based on the adjusted price or the original appointment price. Don’t forget to hit\nSave\nwhen you’re done!\nHow can I remove tax from a late cancellation?\nHead over to the patient’s profile, click\nBilling\nand under\nPurchases\n, click\nView\nto the right of the invoice.\nNow you can uncheck the\nThis purchase is taxable\nsetting.\nFeedback and Feature Requests\nHere are a few Feature Requests we think many of you might have. We’d love it if you’d add your feedback by clicking on the links below so we can use it as we think about how to continue building on this feature:\nI want Jane to automatically email my client their Late Cancellation Invoice\nI want to filter a report to show only my Late Cancellations\nI want clients to be able to late cancel their own appointment through their My Account portal.\nI’d like to make a new Feature Request.\nIs there something else you think would make a helpful addition to this feature?
