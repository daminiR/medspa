Appointments can be cancelled or deleted for all kinds of reasons, and Jane makes it easy to keep your schedule up to date. You can cancel or delete appointments one at a time, or remove multiple appointments for a patient all at once.
Cancel or Delete a Single Appointment
There may be times when you need to remove an appointment from the schedule, whether a client cancels, doesn’t show up, or the booking was made in error. In Jane, you can choose to cancel the appointment or delete it entirely. Here’s how each option works.
Heads Up❗️ Appointments can’t be cancelled or deleted if they’re marked as
Arrived
. If you’ve already arrived the visit, just click the
Arrive
button again to un-arrive it. It should no longer appear green. Once that’s done, you’ll be able to cancel or remove the appointment as needed.
Now, let’s get your schedule in order!
To cancel or delete an appointment, start by clicking on the appointment in your schedule to open the Appointment panel. From there, open the
Booking Info
section and click the
Cancel/Delete
button in the bottom-right corner.
If the client needs to be notified, choose one of the
Cancel with Notifications
options.
Jane Tip 💙 If it’s a late cancellation, you can choose to apply a
Late Cancellation Fee
by setting up a fee that updates the cost of the cancelled appointment.
Once you select your cancel option, you’ll be prompted to select a
Reason for Cancellation
, and then you can click
Save & Cancel Appointment
to confirm.
Jane Tip 💙 If you select
Other Reason
, Jane will prompt you to enter a custom reason for the cancellation. This custom note will appear in the
Appointments Report
. If you’d like to tailor the list of cancellation reasons, a
Full Access
user can do so by heading to
Settings > Language > Admin Site: Cancellation Reasons
.
If no notification is needed, for example, if something was booked in error and you’re immediately deleting it, you can choose
Delete Appointment
(Without notifications). Just click
Delete Appointment
in the confirmation window to complete the removal.
When to Cancel vs. Delete an Appointment
Understanding the difference between cancelling and deleting appointments helps ensure your records stay accurate and clients are notified appropriately when needed.
Cancel an appointment when:
The client no longer needs the visit or has contacted you to cancel.
You want Jane to send a cancellation email to the client. This email is sent
3 minutes
after cancellation, but if the appointment is uncancelled within that window, no notification will go out.
You’d like to track the reason for cancellation, either by choosing a predefined option or entering a custom reason.
Note: The reason for cancellation is not included in the client’s email for privacy reasons.
Delete an appointment when:
The appointment was booked in error or needs to be removed without notifying the client.
You don’t want any communication sent to the client.
You’re cleaning up the schedule, and you’re okay with the appointment being removed from view (though you can still see it by enabling Deleted appointments in your Schedule Settings).
Delete Multiple Appointments for a Patient
If a patient has a series of upcoming visits that need to be removed, you can delete multiple appointments at once, but only from the Book Recurring Appointments window. These appointments can’t be cancelled in bulk; they can only be deleted.
To get started, find one of the patient’s appointments, either from your schedule or directly from their profile, and click on it to open the Appointment panel. Then, click the
» button
next to the
Move
option to open the Book Recurring Appointments window.
From there, check the box at the top labelled
Show all upcoming appointments
to view the full list. You can delete appointments individually by clicking the
trash can
icon next to each one, or remove them all at once by clicking the
Delete X Booked Appointments
button in the bottom-left corner.
Viewing Cancelled & Deleted Appointments on the Schedule
You can choose whether to show or hide cancelled and deleted appointments on your schedule, depending on what’s most helpful for your workflow.
When visible, both cancelled and deleted appointments will appear in grey.
To adjust your view, click the
settings gear icon
in the bottom-right corner of your schedule. From there, you can toggle on or off
Cancelled Appointments
and
Deleted Appointments
as needed.

FAQs
How can I book a new appointment when a cancelled, rescheduled, or deleted appointment is still visible in the time slot?
If you’re trying to book a new appointment but a cancelled, rescheduled, or deleted visit is still taking up the time slot on your schedule, you have a couple of options.
The first option is to temporarily hide those appointment types. Just click the
settings gear icon
in the bottom-right corner of your schedule and use the toggles to turn off
Cancelled
,
Deleted
, or
Rescheduled
appointments. Then, return to your schedule and book the new appointment as usual. Once you’re done, you can go back to the settings gear and toggle those appointment types back on if you prefer to keep them visible.
The second option is to use
double booking mode
. Press the
letter “D”
on your keyboard to temporarily enable double booking. This will shift any cancelled or deleted appointments to the side, making room to book the new visit. Once you’ve finished, press
“D”
again to turn double booking off, and everything will slide neatly back into place.
Can I uncancel an appointment?
You sure can! If you cancelled an appointment by mistake, or if the client changed their mind, you can easily reverse it. Just open the cancelled appointment and click the
Uncancel
button, located in the same spot where you’d normally see the
Cancel/Delete
button for a booked appointment.
Heads Up❗️When you cancel an appointment, Jane sends a cancellation email to the client after a
3-minute delay
. If you uncancel the visit before that time is up, no notification will be sent.
Can I change the appointment type without cancelling and rebooking?
Yes, absolutely! If someone books the wrong type of appointment, like a follow-up instead of an initial, you can simply update it by clicking the
pencil icon
on the Appointment panel.
This is especially handy if you need to switch the appointment format, such as from an in-person visit to a Telehealth session.
Heads Up❗️ The pencil icon is only available if the appointment hasn’t been marked as
Arrived
. If it has, you’ll need to unarrive it first. If payment has already been received, this may involve
unapplying the payment
temporarily. You can learn more here:
Unapplying a Payment
Does the cancellation reason show up in a patient’s email?
Nope, for privacy reasons, Jane does
not
include the cancellation reason in the client’s email notification.
If you’d like to review or edit the cancellation reasons available to clients or patients, a staff member with
Full Access or the Account Owner
can head to
Settings > Language
, then look under:
Patient’s My Account: Cancellation Reasons
Admin Site: Cancellation Reasons
You can learn more about customizing these fields in our
Customizing Language in Jane
guide.
Can I delete all appointments in a day for different patients?
At the moment, Jane doesn’t offer a way to bulk cancel or delete appointments across multiple patients. You can only delete multiple appointments at once if they belong to the
same patient
.
If you need to remove appointments for different patients on the same day, you’ll need to cancel or delete them
individually
.
We hope this helps! As always, feel free to
reach out
to us if you have any questions. We’re happy to help.

Thrive PlanAppointments can be cancelled or deleted for all kinds of reasons, and Jane makes it easy to keep your schedule up to date. You can cancel or delete appointments one at a time, or remove multiple appointments for a patient all at once.
Cancel or Delete a Single Appointment
There may be times when you need to remove an appointment from the schedule, whether a client cancels, doesn’t show up, or the booking was made in error. In Jane, you can choose to cancel the appointment or delete it entirely. Here’s how each option works.
Heads Up❗️ Appointments can’t be cancelled or deleted if they’re marked as
Arrived
. If you’ve already arrived the visit, just click the
Arrive
button again to un-arrive it. It should no longer appear green. Once that’s done, you’ll be able to cancel or remove the appointment as needed.
Now, let’s get your schedule in order!
To cancel or delete an appointment, start by clicking on the appointment in your schedule to open the Appointment panel. From there, open the
Booking Info
section and click the
Cancel/Delete
button in the bottom-right corner.
If the client needs to be notified, choose one of the
Cancel with Notifications
options.
Jane Tip 💙 If it’s a late cancellation, you can choose to apply a
Late Cancellation Fee
by setting up a fee that updates the cost of the cancelled appointment.
Once you select your cancel option, you’ll be prompted to select a
Reason for Cancellation
, and then you can click
Save & Cancel Appointment
to confirm.
Jane Tip 💙 If you select
Other Reason
, Jane will prompt you to enter a custom reason for the cancellation. This custom note will appear in the
Appointments Report
. If you’d like to tailor the list of cancellation reasons, a
Full Access
user can do so by heading to
Settings > Language > Admin Site: Cancellation Reasons
.
If no notification is needed, for example, if something was booked in error and you’re immediately deleting it, you can choose
Delete Appointment
(Without notifications). Just click
Delete Appointment
in the confirmation window to complete the removal.
When to Cancel vs. Delete an Appointment
Understanding the difference between cancelling and deleting appointments helps ensure your records stay accurate and clients are notified appropriately when needed.
Cancel an appointment when:
The client no longer needs the visit or has contacted you to cancel.
You want Jane to send a cancellation email to the client. This email is sent
3 minutes
after cancellation, but if the appointment is uncancelled within that window, no notification will go out.
You’d like to track the reason for cancellation, either by choosing a predefined option or entering a custom reason.
Note: The reason for cancellation is not included in the client’s email for privacy reasons.
Delete an appointment when:
The appointment was booked in error or needs to be removed without notifying the client.
You don’t want any communication sent to the client.
You’re cleaning up the schedule, and you’re okay with the appointment being removed from view (though you can still see it by enabling Deleted appointments in your Schedule Settings).
Delete Multiple Appointments for a Patient
If a patient has a series of upcoming visits that need to be removed, you can delete multiple appointments at once, but only from the Book Recurring Appointments window. These appointments can’t be cancelled in bulk; they can only be deleted.
To get started, find one of the patient’s appointments, either from your schedule or directly from their profile, and click on it to open the Appointment panel. Then, click the
» button
next to the
Move
option to open the Book Recurring Appointments window.
From there, check the box at the top labelled
Show all upcoming appointments
to view the full list. You can delete appointments individually by clicking the
trash can
icon next to each one, or remove them all at once by clicking the
Delete X Booked Appointments
button in the bottom-left corner.
Viewing Cancelled & Deleted Appointments on the Schedule
You can choose whether to show or hide cancelled and deleted appointments on your schedule, depending on what’s most helpful for your workflow.
When visible, both cancelled and deleted appointments will appear in grey.
To adjust your view, click the
settings gear icon
in the bottom-right corner of your schedule. From there, you can toggle on or off
Cancelled Appointments
and
Deleted Appointments
as needed.

Who was Cancelled or Deleted from the Schedule

FAQs
How can I book a new appointment when a cancelled, rescheduled, or deleted appointment is still visible in the time slot?
If you’re trying to book a new appointment but a cancelled, rescheduled, or deleted visit is still taking up the time slot on your schedule, you have a couple of options.
The first option is to temporarily hide those appointment types. Just click the
settings gear icon
in the bottom-right corner of your schedule and use the toggles to turn off
Cancelled
,
Deleted
, or
Rescheduled
appointments. Then, return to your schedule and book the new appointment as usual. Once you’re done, you can go back to the settings gear and toggle those appointment types back on if you prefer to keep them visible.
The second option is to use
double booking mode
. Press the
letter “D”
on your keyboard to temporarily enable double booking. This will shift any cancelled or deleted appointments to the side, making room to book the new visit. Once you’ve finished, press
“D”
again to turn double booking off, and everything will slide neatly back into place.
Can I uncancel an appointment?
You sure can! If you cancelled an appointment by mistake, or if the client changed their mind, you can easily reverse it. Just open the cancelled appointment and click the
Uncancel
button, located in the same spot where you’d normally see the
Cancel/Delete
button for a booked appointment.
Heads Up❗️When you cancel an appointment, Jane sends a cancellation email to the client after a
3-minute delay
. If you uncancel the visit before that time is up, no notification will be sent.
Can I change the appointment type without cancelling and rebooking?
Yes, absolutely! If someone books the wrong type of appointment, like a follow-up instead of an initial, you can simply update it by clicking the
pencil icon
on the Appointment panel.
This is especially handy if you need to switch the appointment format, such as from an in-person visit to a Telehealth session.
Heads Up❗️ The pencil icon is only available if the appointment hasn’t been marked as
Arrived
. If it has, you’ll need to unarrive it first. If payment has already been received, this may involve
unapplying the payment
temporarily. You can learn more here:
Unapplying a Payment
Does the cancellation reason show up in a patient’s email?
Nope, for privacy reasons, Jane does
not
include the cancellation reason in the client’s email notification.
If you’d like to review or edit the cancellation reasons available to clients or patients, a staff member with
Full Access or the Account Owner
can head to
Settings > Language
, then look under:
Patient’s My Account: Cancellation Reasons
Admin Site: Cancellation Reasons
You can learn more about customizing these fields in our
Customizing Language in Jane
guide.
Can I delete all appointments in a day for different patients?
At the moment, Jane doesn’t offer a way to bulk cancel or delete appointments across multiple patients. You can only delete multiple appointments at once if they belong to the
same patient
.
If you need to remove appointments for different patients on the same day, you’ll need to cancel or delete them
individually
.
We hope this helps! As always, feel free to
