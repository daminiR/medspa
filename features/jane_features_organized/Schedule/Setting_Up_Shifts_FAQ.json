I deleted a shift, but now I can’t see the patients scheduled for that day!\nA. Shifts: The Fundamentals 🏗️\nWhat are shifts?\nShifts make it easy for Front-Desk Staff to know when the practitioner is available to book in with. Within the administrative schedule, shifts are represented by the blue background you see here. The white space represents the time that staff are unavailable to book in with.\nAnd within the online booking site, clients can book within shifts so long as their Online Booking Options are set to “Bookable Online”. When the shift is set to “Not Bookable Online”, a client will see the shift as “Booked”, or where there is no shift at all, the client will see this “No Availability”.\nNote that\nOnline Booking Options\nare set at the time of creating your shifts, and can be changed when needed.\nHow do I change the gridlines in my schedule?\nYou can change your schedule gridlines by heading on over to\nSettings > Schedule Settings\nand then you can select your\nSchedule Grid\noption from the drop-down menu.\nIf you are a multidisciplinary clinic and you have differing gridline requirements, we recommend choosing your lowest common denominator. For example, if your Massage Therapist works on a 15-minute gridline, and your Chiropractor works on a 10-minute gridline, we recommend choosing a 5-minute gridline as your lowest common denominator.\nTo learn more about gridlines,\nclick here\n.\nCan I print all existing shifts for multiple staff members for the week?\nWhile there isn’t a direct way to do this, there’s a helpful alternative! You can head over to the\nReports\ntab and click on\nHours Scheduled / Booked\n. This report shows the scheduled hours for each staff member and the time they spend with patients. Click on the staff member’s name in blue to open a new tab with a printable version of their schedule. There isn’t a way to select multiple staff at a time to appear on this version of the exported report at the moment.\nCan I schedule appointments before or after my shift starts/ends?\nIf you’d like to keep your current shift schedule but still book appointments outside those hours, a staff member with\nFull Access\ncan go to\nSettings\n>\nSchedule Settings\nand turn off the\n‘Prevent staff from booking outside of shifts’\noption.\nIf your schedule doesn’t cover the time of your appointment (for example, if your appointment is at 8 AM but your schedule starts at 9 AM), you can adjust the\nOpening or Closing hours\nto include the needed time.\nAccount Owner or Full Access Required\nHow do I change my clinic’s opening and closing hours?\nTo change your clinic’s opening and closing hours, head on over to\nSettings > Schedule Settings\nand you’ll find your clinic opening hours and closing hours at the top of the page.\nWe recommend setting your clinic opening hours an hour prior to your shift start time, and your clinic closing hours an hour after your shift end time. This gives Front-Desk Staff a bit more flexibility if they need to book outside of a shift.\nBonus!\n✨ It also makes your Online Booking Site look good 😉\nTo learn more about clinic closing and opening times,\nclick here\n.\nAccount Owner or Full Access Required\nI’d like to turn off the ability for my Front-Desk staff to book outside of our scheduled shifts. How do I do that?\nGlad you asked! We have a spiffy feature for that hiding within our\nSchedule Settings.\nTake a look at\nthis guide\n, and let us know if any questions come up!\n**\nAccount Owner or Full Access Required\nWill my clients be able to book within my clinic’s closing and opening hours?\nYes & no… Your clinic’s\nclosing and opening hours\nare the\nboundaries\nthat you can book your\nshifts\nwithin. Shifts in Jane are what dictate your availability — and the shifts will need to be made “\nBookable Online\n” in order for clients to see your availability online. So, your clients will only be able to book within your clinic’s closing and opening hours if you have created shifts in your schedule.\nAre clients able to book appointments outside of shifts?\nNo, clients are never able to book appointments outside of a shift. On your online booking site, appointments outside of a shift will display as “No Availability” and your clients will not be able to book appointments at those times. If you notice a client booked outside of a shift, it is possible that the appointment was booked administratively by a staff member or there was a shift there at the time of the client booking but the shift has since been removed. If this has come up for you and you’d like help looking into it, please feel free to\nContact Us\n.\n2. Manage Shifts 🏡\nHow do I access Manage Shifts?\nIn the top right-hand corner of your\nSchedule View,\nselect the drop-down arrow to the right of the “\nShifts\n” button. There you’ll find “\nManage Shifts\n”. Selecting this will open up your Manage Shifts window.\nHow do I set the date range for my shifts?\nWithin the Manage Shifts window, click into each date field to select your\nStart Date\nand\nEnd Date\nfrom the date picker. You can choose the month and year from the drop-down menus, or the\nright\narrow in the top right-hand corner of the date picker to flip through one month at a time:\nWhy is the date range so important?\nOkay, you got me! This hasn’t been a frequently asked question at Jane, but it’s\nSO\nimportant, so much so that I decided to ask it myself. The dates chosen from the date pickers will let Jane know the date range of your repeated shift schedule.\nIt’s also important to be cognizant of the\ndate range\nas you will have the ability to easily\noverride your shifts that\ncurrently exist within your schedule based on the date range that you’ve chosen.\nLet’s show an example:\nIf I were to proceed with saving the below Empty Shift Schedule, I am telling Jane to remove Zoey’s existing shifts between May 16 - May 22.\n❗\nA good rule of thumb is:\nNo Shifts = No Availability (Jane will override your existing shifts)\n❗\nDo not click ‘\nApply Shift Schedule’\nunless you intend to override your shift schedule based on the date range that you’ve chosen.\nWhat is the relation between the\nDays of the Week and my Date Range?\nThe days of the week displayed on the left-hand side represent the days that will be modified within the date range you’ve selected. The date order on the left-hand side is not intended to match the order of the dates chosen within the date picker on the right. Rather, this is your opportunity to add or remove shifts to “Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays etc.” — those days of the week that fall within your date range.\nIn this quick example, I’m telling Jane to update all of my Mondays - Fridays in my existing shift schedule to 8 AM - 5 PM (between May 12th and Dec 31st), and I’m also telling Jane to remove all shifts from Sundays & Saturdays that fall within this date range as well.\nWhere can I access my shift settings?\nClick into Jane’s handy icon bar, and you’ll find out! 🙂 You’ll have the option of selecting a\nroom\n.\nWhy are my “\nRooms\n” and “\nTags\n” not showing up within the Icon bar window?\nIf you need to work with\nRooms\n(to limit treatment availability),\nyou’ll need to ensure two things:\n1. Your\nAdvanced Scheduling\nis\nturned on\nfirst in order for these options to be available for you within the icon bar window; and,\n2. You have created rooms to choose from.\nTo learn how to do this, you can click on the links above.\nAccount Owner or Full Access Required\nHow do I repeat my shift to other days of the week?\nTo the right of the shift, you’ll find a little square icon. When you click that, Jane will provide you with the option of copying the shift you’ve created to other days of the week as well. Click\nCopy Times\nto complete your action.\nHow do I apply my new shift schedule to multiple practitioners?\nWith the\nManage Shifts\ntool open, check off the names of the staff members to the right-hand side. Jane will\noverride\nthose staff members’ existing shift schedules (within the date range you’ve chosen) to match the new shift schedule to the left.\nI have a new staff member starting. I’d like their shifts to match an existing shift schedule I’ve already created. How do I do this?\nFrom your schedule view,\nselect your staff member’s name\nwhose shifts you’d like copied. Ensure you are in your\nseven-day week view\n. If you aren’t, simply click “Week” or type the number “7” on your keyboard.\nThen, open up Manage Shifts. Jane will know to bring up your selected staff member’s existing shifts. To apply this shift schedule to your new staff member, simply select their name on the left, exactly as we did above. 👆\n3. Building on the Basics: Overriding Shift Availability & More! ✂️\nCan I use\nManage Shifts\nto change the\nfrequency of my shifts\n(i.e., biweekly, etc.)?\nThe Manage Shifts tool does\nnot\nhave the option to specify the frequency of your shift schedule (i.e., biweekly) which means that if a shift is added it will be added\nweekly for the given date range.\nTo learn more about creating a biweekly shift schedule, please visit our\nEdit Individual Shifts\nguide and scroll down to the last section.\nHow do I remove a single shift from one practitioner’s schedule?\nIn this case, we’d recommend using the\nEdit Individual Shifts**\ntool in Jane. Jump down to the “\nRemove Shifts**” section, and let us know if any questions come up!\nHow do I remove a single shift from multiple practitioner’s schedules?\nStarting off in your\nschedule view\n, click the “\n+\n” to the right of each staff member’s name whose shift schedule you’d like to change.\nThen, with your\nManage Shifts\ntool open, you can make things super easy for yourself by\nsetting your date range to the exact date you’d like removed\nfrom your staff member’s schedules. Then, just be sure that the weekday has no shift populated (if it does, hit the\nX).\nFinally, check off the staff members this change applies to and select\nApply Shift Schedule.\n🔴\nWarning:\nThere should be blue messages (i.e., “\nNo Sundays available within the selected dates\n”) below each day on the left, except for the single day you’ve chosen in your date range.\nIf not, then it’s a good sign that your date range is not set to just one day.\nHow do I remove multiple shifts from one practitioner’s schedule?\nIn this case, Jane’s\nManage Shifts\ntool will get the job done faster.\nImportant first step: Select your staff member within your schedule view first.\nOpen up your\nManage Shifts\ntool,\nset the date range to the exact dates you’d like removed\n, then be sure that there are\nno shifts populating\nto the left of your Manage Shifts window. If there are, simply click the\nX\nto remove them.\nHere’s a fresh example after having removed all of my shifts to the left so that Zoey can go on holiday between\nDecember 25th and January 1st.\nHow do I override multiple shifts from multiple practitioners’ schedules?\nImportant first step: Hover your mouse over each staff member’s name in your schedule view whose shifts you’d like to override, and click the “+” to the right to select multiple staff members.\nNow, with the Manage Shifts window open, you can select your date range in which you’d like your shift schedules removed, select your staff members from your staff list, and remove any shifts to the left. If your shift schedule is\nempty\n, then\nJane will know to remove all existing shifts within the date range you’ve chosen.\n💡\nNote\n:\nBeing the overprotective parents that we are, Jane would like to remind your clinic to be extra careful when selecting the date range here. Any shifts within this range will be removed so long as your shift schedule is empty.\nIn this example below, I am removing\nALL EXISTING SHIFTS\nfor Amy, Jonathan, and Zoey between\nDecember 25th and January 1st.\n🔴\nWarning:\nIf you see\nno Shifts populated to the left\nof your Manage Shifts window, and you proceed by clicking “\nApply Shift Schedule\n”, then you are\noverriding your existing schedule\nby\nremoving all existing shifts between this date range.\nJane will open a pop-up box that says, “\nPlease note: if you already have shifts created, continuing will override those shifts”.\nD. Troubleshooting\nWhy haven’t my shifts populated in my schedule? I just created them in Manage Shifts, but they haven’t appeared.\nLet’s give Jane a quick\nrefresh\n. If you’re on a Mac, click Command+R on your keyboard as a quick keyboard shortcut. This will bring up those shifts you’ve just created.\nWhy haven’t any shifts populated\nin my Manage Shifts window\n? I know I have shifts scheduled on those dates, but they are not appearing.\nThere are\ntwo scenarios\nwhere shifts will\nnot populate\nwithin your\nManage Shifts\nwindow:\nNo staff members were selected within your schedule view prior to opening the Manage Shifts tool;\nMore than one staff member was selected within your schedule view\nprior to using Manage Shifts. Understandably, Jane cannot show corresponding shifts for more than one staff member for each day of the week.\nIf either of these two options are chosen, you’ll see an empty shift schedule:\n🔴 Please be careful here as saving this window will\noverride\nany existing shifts (by removing them) from your current shift schedule.\nWhy is Jane pulling shifts into my Manage Shifts Tool?\nWhen we select a\nsingle practitioner from our schedule view,\nJane will use your existing schedule to populate your\nManage Shifts Date Range\n. That might be any number of days between 1-7.\n⭐ Pro Tip #1: With one staff member selected in your schedule view, and with your\nManage Shifts\ntool open, you can click the “\nN\n” on your keyboard to automatically change your date range to\nnext\nweek’s shift schedule. Or, click “\nP\n” on your keyboard to go to the staff member’s\nprevious\nweek’s shift schedule.\nWe’re full of tips today, so here’s another!\n⭐ Pro Tip #2: With the Manage Shifts tool open, type number one on your keyboard, and Jane will populate your Date Range to the first Sunday you have in your Schedule View. Try typing number two all the way up to the number seven to see Jane automatically update the Date Range for you.\nHelp! My shifts have all disappeared. What happened, and how can I fix this?\nAck…It sounds like you may have saved a blank shift schedule using the Manage Shifts tool. When a blank shift schedule is saved, we are essentially telling Jane to override our existing shifts to match the new shift schedule (\neven if your new shift schedule is empty\n). Luckily, it’s quite simple to recreate your shift schedule using the Manage Shifts tool. You can visit our guide “\nSetting Up Shifts\n” to learn how. If you need any assistance with this, please do not hesitate to contact support. Our email is support@janeapp.com.\nWhy are my appointments displaying in a separate column from my shift?\nThis can happen when we accidentally apply a new Shift Schedule to the\nwrong Room\n. Let’s correct this together. First, click on the appointment and review the room it’s assigned to. In our below example, we can see the appointment is assigned to\nRoom 1\n, whereas the shift is assigned to\nRoom 2.\nI’ll need to update my shifts to\nRoom 1\n.\nNext, select the staff member within your schedule. Then, let’s open the\nManage Shifts\ntool to update the room assignment by clicking on the icon bar. From there, you’ll have the option of selecting the correct room from the drop-down menu. Just be sure that the correct time frame is chosen before saving. Once saved, Jane will move all of the appointments into the updated shift. Easy peasy!\nNote:\nIf your appointment was booked in the wrong room, simply drag and drop your appointment into your new shift and Jane will automatically update the room.\nHow can I update my shifts so that they are ‘Bookable Online’?\nFirst, let’s select our staff member to the left of the schedule, and ensure that we are in our 7-day view by selecting “\nWeek\n”.\nThen, let’s open up our Manage Shifts tool. To update your shifts to bookable online, click on the icon bar and select “Bookable Online”. Then just be sure that you’ve selected the correct time frame and practitioner, and proceed with saving your changes.\nWhy are some icons in my icon bar blue, while others are black?\nOooh yes, we’re glad you noticed. This is to help users know when a specific setting has been\nenabled\n.\nA\nblue\nmonitor means the shift is bookable online.\nA\nblue\nphone means it’s been marked “contact to book.”\nA\nblue\nhouse means a room has been assigned to the shift.\nA\nblue\npencil means a note is present on the shift.\nAll black icons mean none of the above settings have been created just yet.\nBooked vs No Availability language on the Online Booking Site\nEver wondered why some of the shifts on your online booking site say\nBooked\nand some say\nNo Availability\n? That’s Jane trying to be helpful in differentiating when you are available, you’re all booked up and days you’re just not available.\nThe\nBooked\nand\nNo Availability\ntext is currently hard-coded and can’t be customized at the moment. There are three scenarios where this text appears:\nThis text will appear in the middle of a scheduled shift where there are appointments available but all the slots have been booked.\nIf you add a break in your schedule at a time that’s usually open for appointments.\nThere are also Online Booking settings that impact how and when this text appears.\nHow Breaks and Shifts Impact Online Availability:\nIn the image below, the patient selected the\n30-minute massage treatment\n. Since Susan has no shift scheduled on Friday or Saturday, Jane is displaying that there is No Availability.\nHowever, for today, there is both a shift and appointments booked in and since the Booked text only appears in the middle of a shift, we can see it peeking through just above that 4:30 PM availability.\nNow, lets pop in a shift and a break on Friday. With both of those added to the schedule, Jane is displaying the\nBooked\ntext.\nBook by Staff Member vs Book by Treatment:\nFrom an individual’s staff booking page, there are two phrases patients will see;\nNo Availability\nif a shift has not been put in for a particular day, and\nBooked\nif a shift has been scheduled but has been booked up.\nIf patients first click on an\nappointment type\n, rather than a\nstaff member\n, they will see a schedule that shows the availability of all staff who offer that appointment type.\nOn this version of the online booking page, they will either see open appointment times to book, or\nNo Availability\non days that no staff member can offer the appointment.\nPatients will not see the word\nBooked\nbecause Jane is showing the availability of multiple staff members (even if you’re running solo), so there aren’t specific shifts being displayed.\nWhile this isn’t something that we can change, there is an option to update your online booking settings.\nAdjusting your Online Booking Settings\nTo view this, a staff member with\nAdministrative / All Billing Access\nwill want to head over to the\nSettings\ntab, select\nOnline Booking\nin the left sidebar menu and toggle off\nBook by Treatment\n.\nThey’ll want to make sure that\nBook by Staff\nis toggled on though before confirming those changes.\nFor more details on on the options in this area, you can head over to our\nOnline Booking: Choosing What Is Offered Online (Locations, Staff, Shifts, Treatments etc) and Individual Staff Preferences\nguide.\nHelp! I deleted a shift but now I can’t see the patients scheduled for that day!\nNot to worry, those appointments are still on the schedule! You’ll just want click on the\nShifts\nbutton in the top right corner (so it’s white again) of the\nSchedule\ntab and voila!\nYou should see those patient appointments reappear.\nAdditional Resources\nIf you haven’t seen them already, we have a handful of guides to help you navigate your schedule and manage your shifts:\nSetting Up Shifts\nSetting the Schedule Grid\nSchedule Closing and Opening Time\nStep 5 - Schedule\nFront Desk Training - Chapter 1: Schedule\nEdit Individual Shifts\nAs always, we love hearing from you!

I deleted a shift, but now I can’t see the patients scheduled for that day!\nA. Shifts: The Fundamentals 🏗️\nWhat are shifts?\nShifts make it easy for Front-Desk Staff to know when the practitioner is available to book in with. Within the administrative schedule, shifts are represented by the blue background you see here. The white space represents the time that staff are unavailable to book in with.\nAnd within the online booking site, clients can book within shifts so long as their Online Booking Options are set to “Bookable Online”. When the shift is set to “Not Bookable Online”, a client will see the shift as “Booked”, or where there is no shift at all, the client will see this “No Availability”.\nNote that\nOnline Booking Options\nare set at the time of creating your shifts, and can be changed when needed.\nHow do I change the gridlines in my schedule?\nYou can change your schedule gridlines by heading on over to\nSettings > Schedule Settings\nand then you can select your\nSchedule Grid\noption from the drop-down menu.\nIf you are a multidisciplinary clinic and you have differing gridline requirements, we recommend choosing your lowest common denominator. For example, if your Massage Therapist works on a 15-minute gridline, and your Chiropractor works on a 10-minute gridline, we recommend choosing a 5-minute gridline as your lowest common denominator.\nTo learn more about gridlines,\nclick here\n.\nCan I print all existing shifts for multiple staff members for the week?\nWhile there isn’t a direct way to do this, there’s a helpful alternative! You can head over to the\nReports\ntab and click on\nHours Scheduled / Booked\n. This report shows the scheduled hours for each staff member and the time they spend with patients. Click on the staff member’s name in blue to open a new tab with a printable version of their schedule. There isn’t a way to select multiple staff at a time to appear on this version of the exported report at the moment.\nCan I schedule appointments before or after my shift starts/ends?\nIf you’d like to keep your current shift schedule but still book appointments outside those hours, a staff member with\nFull Access\ncan go to\nSettings\n>\nSchedule Settings\nand turn off the\n‘Prevent staff from booking outside of shifts’\noption.\nIf your schedule doesn’t cover the time of your appointment (for example, if your appointment is at 8 AM but your schedule starts at 9 AM), you can adjust the\nOpening or Closing hours\nto include the needed time.\nAccount Owner or Full Access Required\nHow do I change my clinic’s opening and closing hours?\nTo change your clinic’s opening and closing hours, head on over to\nSettings > Schedule Settings\nand you’ll find your clinic opening hours and closing hours at the top of the page.\nWe recommend setting your clinic opening hours an hour prior to your shift start time, and your clinic closing hours an hour after your shift end time. This gives Front-Desk Staff a bit more flexibility if they need to book outside of a shift.\nBonus!\n✨ It also makes your Online Booking Site look good 😉\nTo learn more about clinic closing and opening times,\nclick here\n.\nAccount Owner or Full Access Required\nI’d like to turn off the ability for my Front-Desk staff to book outside of our scheduled shifts. How do I do that?\nGlad you asked! We have a spiffy feature for that hiding within our\nSchedule Settings.\nTake a look at\nthis guide\n, and let us know if any questions come up!\n**\nAccount Owner or Full Access Required\nWill my clients be able to book within my clinic’s closing and opening hours?\nYes & no… Your clinic’s\nclosing and opening hours\nare the\nboundaries\nthat you can book your\nshifts\nwithin. Shifts in Jane are what dictate your availability — and the shifts will need to be made “\nBookable Online\n” in order for clients to see your availability online. So, your clients will only be able to book within your clinic’s closing and opening hours if you have created shifts in your schedule.\nAre clients able to book appointments outside of shifts?\nNo, clients are never able to book appointments outside of a shift. On your online booking site, appointments outside of a shift will display as “No Availability” and your clients will not be able to book appointments at those times. If you notice a client booked outside of a shift, it is possible that the appointment was booked administratively by a staff member or there was a shift there at the time of the client booking but the shift has since been removed. If this has come up for you and you’d like help looking into it, please feel free to\nContact Us\n.\n2. Manage Shifts 🏡\nHow do I access Manage Shifts?\nIn the top right-hand corner of your\nSchedule View,\nselect the drop-down arrow to the right of the “\nShifts\n” button. There you’ll find “\nManage Shifts\n”. Selecting this will open up your Manage Shifts window.\nHow do I set the date range for my shifts?\nWithin the Manage Shifts window, click into each date field to select your\nStart Date\nand\nEnd Date\nfrom the date picker. You can choose the month and year from the drop-down menus, or the\nright\narrow in the top right-hand corner of the date picker to flip through one month at a time:\nWhy is the date range so important?\nOkay, you got me! This hasn’t been a frequently asked question at Jane, but it’s\nSO\nimportant, so much so that I decided to ask it myself. The dates chosen from the date pickers will let Jane know the date range of your repeated shift schedule.\nIt’s also important to be cognizant of the\ndate range\nas you will have the ability to easily\noverride your shifts that\ncurrently exist within your schedule based on the date range that you’ve chosen.\nLet’s show an example:\nIf I were to proceed with saving the below Empty Shift Schedule, I am telling Jane to remove Zoey’s existing shifts between May 16 - May 22.\n❗\nA good rule of thumb is:\nNo Shifts = No Availability (Jane will override your existing shifts)\n❗\nDo not click ‘\nApply Shift Schedule’\nunless you intend to override your shift schedule based on the date range that you’ve chosen.\nWhat is the relation between the\nDays of the Week and my Date Range?\nThe days of the week displayed on the left-hand side represent the days that will be modified within the date range you’ve selected. The date order on the left-hand side is not intended to match the order of the dates chosen within the date picker on the right. Rather, this is your opportunity to add or remove shifts to “Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays etc.” — those days of the week that fall within your date range.\nIn this quick example, I’m telling Jane to update all of my Mondays - Fridays in my existing shift schedule to 8 AM - 5 PM (between May 12th and Dec 31st), and I’m also telling Jane to remove all shifts from Sundays & Saturdays that fall within this date range as well.\nWhere can I access my shift settings?\nClick into Jane’s handy icon bar, and you’ll find out! 🙂 You’ll have the option of selecting a\nroom\n.\nWhy are my “\nRooms\n” and “\nTags\n” not showing up within the Icon bar window?\nIf you need to work with\nRooms\n(to limit treatment availability),\nyou’ll need to ensure two things:\n1. Your\nAdvanced Scheduling\nis\nturned on\nfirst in order for these options to be available for you within the icon bar window; and,\n2. You have created rooms to choose from.\nTo learn how to do this, you can click on the links above.\nAccount Owner or Full Access Required\nHow do I repeat my shift to other days of the week?\nTo the right of the shift, you’ll find a little square icon. When you click that, Jane will provide you with the option of copying the shift you’ve created to other days of the week as well. Click\nCopy Times\nto complete your action.\nHow do I apply my new shift schedule to multiple practitioners?\nWith the\nManage Shifts\ntool open, check off the names of the staff members to the right-hand side. Jane will\noverride\nthose staff members’ existing shift schedules (within the date range you’ve chosen) to match the new shift schedule to the left.\nI have a new staff member starting. I’d like their shifts to match an existing shift schedule I’ve already created. How do I do this?\nFrom your schedule view,\nselect your staff member’s name\nwhose shifts you’d like copied. Ensure you are in your\nseven-day week view\n. If you aren’t, simply click “Week” or type the number “7” on your keyboard.\nThen, open up Manage Shifts. Jane will know to bring up your selected staff member’s existing shifts. To apply this shift schedule to your new staff member, simply select their name on the left, exactly as we did above. 👆\n3. Building on the Basics: Overriding Shift Availability & More! ✂️\nCan I use\nManage Shifts\nto change the\nfrequency of my shifts\n(i.e., biweekly, etc.)?\nThe Manage Shifts tool does\nnot\nhave the option to specify the frequency of your shift schedule (i.e., biweekly) which means that if a shift is added it will be added\nweekly for the given date range.\nTo learn more about creating a biweekly shift schedule, please visit our\nEdit Individual Shifts\nguide and scroll down to the last section.\nHow do I remove a single shift from one practitioner’s schedule?\nIn this case, we’d recommend using the\nEdit Individual Shifts**\ntool in Jane. Jump down to the “\nRemove Shifts**” section, and let us know if any questions come up!\nHow do I remove a single shift from multiple practitioner’s schedules?\nStarting off in your\nschedule view\n, click the “\n+\n” to the right of each staff member’s name whose shift schedule you’d like to change.\nThen, with your\nManage Shifts\ntool open, you can make things super easy for yourself by\nsetting your date range to the exact date you’d like removed\nfrom your staff member’s schedules. Then, just be sure that the weekday has no shift populated (if it does, hit the\nX).\nFinally, check off the staff members this change applies to and select\nApply Shift Schedule.\n🔴\nWarning:\nThere should be blue messages (i.e., “\nNo Sundays available within the selected dates\n”) below each day on the left, except for the single day you’ve chosen in your date range.\nIf not, then it’s a good sign that your date range is not set to just one day.\nHow do I remove multiple shifts from one practitioner’s schedule?\nIn this case, Jane’s\nManage Shifts\ntool will get the job done faster.\nImportant first step: Select your staff member within your schedule view first.\nOpen up your\nManage Shifts\ntool,\nset the date range to the exact dates you’d like removed\n, then be sure that there are\nno shifts populating\nto the left of your Manage Shifts window. If there are, simply click the\nX\nto remove them.\nHere’s a fresh example after having removed all of my shifts to the left so that Zoey can go on holiday between\nDecember 25th and January 1st.\nHow do I override multiple shifts from multiple practitioners’ schedules?\nImportant first step: Hover your mouse over each staff member’s name in your schedule view whose shifts you’d like to override, and click the “+” to the right to select multiple staff members.\nNow, with the Manage Shifts window open, you can select your date range in which you’d like your shift schedules removed, select your staff members from your staff list, and remove any shifts to the left. If your shift schedule is\nempty\n, then\nJane will know to remove all existing shifts within the date range you’ve chosen.\n💡\nNote\n:\nBeing the overprotective parents that we are, Jane would like to remind your clinic to be extra careful when selecting the date range here. Any shifts within this range will be removed so long as your shift schedule is empty.\nIn this example below, I am removing\nALL EXISTING SHIFTS\nfor Amy, Jonathan, and Zoey between\nDecember 25th and January 1st.\n🔴\nWarning:\nIf you see\nno Shifts populated to the left\nof your Manage Shifts window, and you proceed by clicking “\nApply Shift Schedule\n”, then you are\noverriding your existing schedule\nby\nremoving all existing shifts between this date range.\nJane will open a pop-up box that says, “\nPlease note: if you already have shifts created, continuing will override those shifts”.\nD. Troubleshooting\nWhy haven’t my shifts populated in my schedule? I just created them in Manage Shifts, but they haven’t appeared.\nLet’s give Jane a quick\nrefresh\n. If you’re on a Mac, click Command+R on your keyboard as a quick keyboard shortcut. This will bring up those shifts you’ve just created.\nWhy haven’t any shifts populated\nin my Manage Shifts window\n? I know I have shifts scheduled on those dates, but they are not appearing.\nThere are\ntwo scenarios\nwhere shifts will\nnot populate\nwithin your\nManage Shifts\nwindow:\nNo staff members were selected within your schedule view prior to opening the Manage Shifts tool;\nMore than one staff member was selected within your schedule view\nprior to using Manage Shifts. Understandably, Jane cannot show corresponding shifts for more than one staff member for each day of the week.\nIf either of these two options are chosen, you’ll see an empty shift schedule:\n🔴 Please be careful here as saving this window will\noverride\nany existing shifts (by removing them) from your current shift schedule.\nWhy is Jane pulling shifts into my Manage Shifts Tool?\nWhen we select a\nsingle practitioner from our schedule view,\nJane will use your existing schedule to populate your\nManage Shifts Date Range\n. That might be any number of days between 1-7.\n⭐ Pro Tip #1: With one staff member selected in your schedule view, and with your\nManage Shifts\ntool open, you can click the “\nN\n” on your keyboard to automatically change your date range to\nnext\nweek’s shift schedule. Or, click “\nP\n” on your keyboard to go to the staff member’s\nprevious\nweek’s shift schedule.\nWe’re full of tips today, so here’s another!\n⭐ Pro Tip #2: With the Manage Shifts tool open, type number one on your keyboard, and Jane will populate your Date Range to the first Sunday you have in your Schedule View. Try typing number two all the way up to the number seven to see Jane automatically update the Date Range for you.\nHelp! My shifts have all disappeared. What happened, and how can I fix this?\nAck…It sounds like you may have saved a blank shift schedule using the Manage Shifts tool. When a blank shift schedule is saved, we are essentially telling Jane to override our existing shifts to match the new shift schedule (\neven if your new shift schedule is empty\n). Luckily, it’s quite simple to recreate your shift schedule using the Manage Shifts tool. You can visit our guide “\nSetting Up Shifts\n” to learn how. If you need any assistance with this, please do not hesitate to contact support. Our email is support@janeapp.com.\nWhy are my appointments displaying in a separate column from my shift?\nThis can happen when we accidentally apply a new Shift Schedule to the\nwrong Room\n. Let’s correct this together. First, click on the appointment and review the room it’s assigned to. In our below example, we can see the appointment is assigned to\nRoom 1\n, whereas the shift is assigned to\nRoom 2.\nI’ll need to update my shifts to\nRoom 1\n.\nNext, select the staff member within your schedule. Then, let’s open the\nManage Shifts\ntool to update the room assignment by clicking on the icon bar. From there, you’ll have the option of selecting the correct room from the drop-down menu. Just be sure that the correct time frame is chosen before saving. Once saved, Jane will move all of the appointments into the updated shift. Easy peasy!\nNote:\nIf your appointment was booked in the wrong room, simply drag and drop your appointment into your new shift and Jane will automatically update the room.\nHow can I update my shifts so that they are ‘Bookable Online’?\nFirst, let’s select our staff member to the left of the schedule, and ensure that we are in our 7-day view by selecting “\nWeek\n”.\nThen, let’s open up our Manage Shifts tool. To update your shifts to bookable online, click on the icon bar and select “Bookable Online”. Then just be sure that you’ve selected the correct time frame and practitioner, and proceed with saving your changes.\nWhy are some icons in my icon bar blue, while others are black?\nOooh yes, we’re glad you noticed. This is to help users know when a specific setting has been\nenabled\n.\nA\nblue\nmonitor means the shift is bookable online.\nA\nblue\nphone means it’s been marked “contact to book.”\nA\nblue\nhouse means a room has been assigned to the shift.\nA\nblue\npencil means a note is present on the shift.\nAll black icons mean none of the above settings have been created just yet.\nBooked vs No Availability language on the Online Booking Site\nEver wondered why some of the shifts on your online booking site say\nBooked\nand some say\nNo Availability\n? That’s Jane trying to be helpful in differentiating when you are available, you’re all booked up and days you’re just not available.\nThe\nBooked\nand\nNo Availability\ntext is currently hard-coded and can’t be customized at the moment. There are three scenarios where this text appears:\nThis text will appear in the middle of a scheduled shift where there are appointments available but all the slots have been booked.\nIf you add a break in your schedule at a time that’s usually open for appointments.\nThere are also Online Booking settings that impact how and when this text appears.\nHow Breaks and Shifts Impact Online Availability:\nIn the image below, the patient selected the\n30-minute massage treatment\n. Since Susan has no shift scheduled on Friday or Saturday, Jane is displaying that there is No Availability.\nHowever, for today, there is both a shift and appointments booked in and since the Booked text only appears in the middle of a shift, we can see it peeking through just above that 4:30 PM availability.\nNow, lets pop in a shift and a break on Friday. With both of those added to the schedule, Jane is displaying the\nBooked\ntext.\nBook by Staff Member vs Book by Treatment:\nFrom an individual’s staff booking page, there are two phrases patients will see;\nNo Availability\nif a shift has not been put in for a particular day, and\nBooked\nif a shift has been scheduled but has been booked up.\nIf patients first click on an\nappointment type\n, rather than a\nstaff member\n, they will see a schedule that shows the availability of all staff who offer that appointment type.\nOn this version of the online booking page, they will either see open appointment times to book, or\nNo Availability\non days that no staff member can offer the appointment.\nPatients will not see the word\nBooked\nbecause Jane is showing the availability of multiple staff members (even if you’re running solo), so there aren’t specific shifts being displayed.\nWhile this isn’t something that we can change, there is an option to update your online booking settings.\nAdjusting your Online Booking Settings\nTo view this, a staff member with\nAdministrative / All Billing Access\nwill want to head over to the\nSettings\ntab, select\nOnline Booking\nin the left sidebar menu and toggle off\nBook by Treatment\n.\nThey’ll want to make sure that\nBook by Staff\nis toggled on though before confirming those changes.\nFor more details on on the options in this area, you can head over to our\nOnline Booking: Choosing What Is Offered Online (Locations, Staff, Shifts, Treatments etc) and Individual Staff Preferences\nguide.\nHelp! I deleted a shift but now I can’t see the patients scheduled for that day!\nNot to worry, those appointments are still on the schedule! You’ll just want click on the\nShifts\nbutton in the top right corner (so it’s white again) of the\nSchedule\ntab and voila!\nYou should see those patient appointments reappear.\nAdditional Resources\nIf you haven’t seen them already, we have a handful of guides to help you navigate your schedule and manage your shifts:\nSetting Up Shifts\nSetting the Schedule Grid\nSchedule Closing and Opening Time\nStep 5 - Schedule\nFront Desk Training - Chapter 1: Schedule\nEdit Individual Shifts\nAs always, we love hearing from you!
