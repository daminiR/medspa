A. Shifts: The Fundamentals 🏗️
What are shifts?
Shifts make it easy for Front-Desk Staff to know when the practitioner is available to book in with. Within the administrative schedule, shifts are represented by the blue background you see here. The white space represents the time that staff are unavailable to book in with.
And within the online booking site, clients can book within shifts so long as their Online Booking Options are set to “Bookable Online”. When the shift is set to “Not Bookable Online”, a client will see the shift as “Booked”, or where there is no shift at all, the client will see this “No Availability”.
Note that
Online Booking Options
are set at the time of creating your shifts, and can be changed when needed.
How do I change the gridlines in my schedule?
You can change your schedule gridlines by heading on over to
Settings > Schedule Settings
and then you can select your
Schedule Grid
option from the drop-down menu.
If you are a multidisciplinary clinic and you have differing gridline requirements, we recommend choosing your lowest common denominator. For example, if your Massage Therapist works on a 15-minute gridline, and your Chiropractor works on a 10-minute gridline, we recommend choosing a 5-minute gridline as your lowest common denominator.
To learn more about gridlines,
click here
.
Can I print all existing shifts for multiple staff members for the week?
While there isn’t a direct way to do this, there’s a helpful alternative! You can head over to the
Reports
tab and click on
Hours Scheduled / Booked
. This report shows the scheduled hours for each staff member and the time they spend with patients. Click on the staff member’s name in blue to open a new tab with a printable version of their schedule. There isn’t a way to select multiple staff at a time to appear on this version of the exported report at the moment.
Can I schedule appointments before or after my shift starts/ends?
If you’d like to keep your current shift schedule but still book appointments outside those hours, a staff member with
Full Access
can go to
Settings
>
Schedule Settings
and turn off the
‘Prevent staff from booking outside of shifts’
option.
If your schedule doesn’t cover the time of your appointment (for example, if your appointment is at 8 AM but your schedule starts at 9 AM), you can adjust the
Opening or Closing hours
to include the needed time.
Account Owner or Full Access Required
How do I change my clinic’s opening and closing hours?
To change your clinic’s opening and closing hours, head on over to
Settings > Schedule Settings
and you’ll find your clinic opening hours and closing hours at the top of the page.
We recommend setting your clinic opening hours an hour prior to your shift start time, and your clinic closing hours an hour after your shift end time. This gives Front-Desk Staff a bit more flexibility if they need to book outside of a shift.
Bonus!
✨ It also makes your Online Booking Site look good 😉

I’d like to turn off the ability for my Front-Desk staff to book outside of our scheduled shifts. How do I do that?
Glad you asked! We have a spiffy feature for that hiding within our
Schedule Settings.
Take a look at
this guide
, and let us know if any questions come up!
**
Account Owner or Full Access Required
Will my clients be able to book within my clinic’s closing and opening hours?
Yes & no… Your clinic’s
closing and opening hours
are the
boundaries
that you can book your
shifts
within. Shifts in Jane are what dictate your availability — and the shifts will need to be made “
Bookable Online
” in order for clients to see your availability online. So, your clients will only be able to book within your clinic’s closing and opening hours if you have created shifts in your schedule.
Are clients able to book appointments outside of shifts?
No, clients are never able to book appointments outside of a shift. On your online booking site, appointments outside of a shift will display as “No Availability” and your clients will not be able to book appointments at those times. If you notice a client booked outside of a shift, it is possible that the appointment was booked administratively by a staff member or there was a shift there at the time of the client booking but the shift has since been removed. If this has come up for you and you’d like help looking into it, please feel free to

2. Manage Shifts 🏡
How do I access Manage Shifts?
In the top right-hand corner of your
Schedule View,
select the drop-down arrow to the right of the “
Shifts
” button. There you’ll find “
Manage Shifts
”. Selecting this will open up your Manage Shifts window.
How do I set the date range for my shifts?
Within the Manage Shifts window, click into each date field to select your
Start Date
and
End Date
from the date picker. You can choose the month and year from the drop-down menus, or the
right
arrow in the top right-hand corner of the date picker to flip through one month at a time:
Why is the date range so important?
Okay, you got me! This hasn’t been a frequently asked question at Jane, but it’s
SO
important, so much so that I decided to ask it myself. The dates chosen from the date pickers will let Jane know the date range of your repeated shift schedule.
It’s also important to be cognizant of the
date range
as you will have the ability to easily
override your shifts that
currently exist within your schedule based on the date range that you’ve chosen.
Let’s show an example:
If I were to proceed with saving the below Empty Shift Schedule, I am telling Jane to remove Zoey’s existing shifts between May 16 - May 22.
❗
A good rule of thumb is:
No Shifts = No Availability (Jane will override your existing shifts)
❗
Do not click ‘
Apply Shift Schedule’
unless you intend to override your shift schedule based on the date range that you’ve chosen.
What is the relation between the
Days of the Week and my Date Range?
The days of the week displayed on the left-hand side represent the days that will be modified within the date range you’ve selected. The date order on the left-hand side is not intended to match the order of the dates chosen within the date picker on the right. Rather, this is your opportunity to add or remove shifts to “Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays etc.” — those days of the week that fall within your date range.
In this quick example, I’m telling Jane to update all of my Mondays - Fridays in my existing shift schedule to 8 AM - 5 PM (between May 12th and Dec 31st), and I’m also telling Jane to remove all shifts from Sundays & Saturdays that fall within this date range as well.
Where can I access my shift settings?
Click into Jane’s handy icon bar, and you’ll find out! 🙂 You’ll have the option of selecting a
room
.
Why are my “
Rooms
” and “
Tags
” not showing up within the Icon bar window?
If you need to work with
Rooms
(to limit treatment availability),
you’ll need to ensure two things:
1. Your
Advanced Scheduling
is
turned on
first in order for these options to be available for you within the icon bar window; and,
2. You have created rooms to choose from.
To learn how to do this, you can click on the links above.
Account Owner or Full Access Required
How do I repeat my shift to other days of the week?
To the right of the shift, you’ll find a little square icon. When you click that, Jane will provide you with the option of copying the shift you’ve created to other days of the week as well. Click
Copy Times
to complete your action.
How do I apply my new shift schedule to multiple practitioners?
With the
Manage Shifts
tool open, check off the names of the staff members to the right-hand side. Jane will
override
those staff members’ existing shift schedules (within the date range you’ve chosen) to match the new shift schedule to the left.
I have a new staff member starting. I’d like their shifts to match an existing shift schedule I’ve already created. How do I do this?
From your schedule view,
select your staff member’s name
whose shifts you’d like copied. Ensure you are in your
seven-day week view
. If you aren’t, simply click “Week” or type the number “7” on your keyboard.
Then, open up Manage Shifts. Jane will know to bring up your selected staff member’s existing shifts. To apply this shift schedule to your new staff member, simply select their name on the left, exactly as we did above. 👆
3. Building on the Basics: Overriding Shift Availability & More! ✂️
Can I use
Manage Shifts
to change the
frequency of my shifts
(i.e., biweekly, etc.)?
The Manage Shifts tool does
not
have the option to specify the frequency of your shift schedule (i.e., biweekly) which means that if a shift is added it will be added
weekly for the given date range.
To learn more about creating a biweekly shift schedule, please visit our
Edit Individual Shifts
guide and scroll down to the last section.
How do I remove a single shift from one practitioner’s schedule?
In this case, we’d recommend using the
Edit Individual Shifts**
tool in Jane. Jump down to the “
Remove Shifts**” section, and let us know if any questions come up!
How do I remove a single shift from multiple practitioner’s schedules?
Starting off in your
schedule view
, click the “
+
” to the right of each staff member’s name whose shift schedule you’d like to change.
Then, with your
Manage Shifts
tool open, you can make things super easy for yourself by
setting your date range to the exact date you’d like removed
from your staff member’s schedules. Then, just be sure that the weekday has no shift populated (if it does, hit the
X).
Finally, check off the staff members this change applies to and select
Apply Shift Schedule.
🔴
Warning:
There should be blue messages (i.e., “
No Sundays available within the selected dates
”) below each day on the left, except for the single day you’ve chosen in your date range.
If not, then it’s a good sign that your date range is not set to just one day.
How do I remove multiple shifts from one practitioner’s schedule?
In this case, Jane’s
Manage Shifts
tool will get the job done faster.
Important first step: Select your staff member within your schedule view first.
Open up your
Manage Shifts
tool,
set the date range to the exact dates you’d like removed
, then be sure that there are
no shifts populating
to the left of your Manage Shifts window. If there are, simply click the
X
to remove them.
Here’s a fresh example after having removed all of my shifts to the left so that Zoey can go on holiday between
December 25th and January 1st.
How do I override multiple shifts from multiple practitioners’ schedules?
Important first step: Hover your mouse over each staff member’s name in your schedule view whose shifts you’d like to override, and click the “+” to the right to select multiple staff members.
Now, with the Manage Shifts window open, you can select your date range in which you’d like your shift schedules removed, select your staff members from your staff list, and remove any shifts to the left. If your shift schedule is
empty
, then
Jane will know to remove all existing shifts within the date range you’ve chosen.
💡
Note
:
Being the overprotective parents that we are, Jane would like to remind your clinic to be extra careful when selecting the date range here. Any shifts within this range will be removed so long as your shift schedule is empty.
In this example below, I am removing
ALL EXISTING SHIFTS
for Amy, Jonathan, and Zoey between
December 25th and January 1st.
🔴
Warning:
If you see
no Shifts populated to the left
of your Manage Shifts window, and you proceed by clicking “
Apply Shift Schedule
”, then you are
overriding your existing schedule
by
removing all existing shifts between this date range.
Jane will open a pop-up box that says, “
Please note: if you already have shifts created, continuing will override those shifts”.
D. Troubleshooting
Why haven’t my shifts populated in my schedule? I just created them in Manage Shifts, but they haven’t appeared.
Let’s give Jane a quick
refresh
. If you’re on a Mac, click Command+R on your keyboard as a quick keyboard shortcut. This will bring up those shifts you’ve just created.
Why haven’t any shifts populated
in my Manage Shifts window
? I know I have shifts scheduled on those dates, but they are not appearing.
There are
two scenarios
where shifts will
not populate
within your
Manage Shifts
window:
No staff members were selected within your schedule view prior to opening the Manage Shifts tool;
More than one staff member was selected within your schedule view
prior to using Manage Shifts. Understandably, Jane cannot show corresponding shifts for more than one staff member for each day of the week.
If either of these two options are chosen, you’ll see an empty shift schedule:
🔴 Please be careful here as saving this window will
override
any existing shifts (by removing them) from your current shift schedule.
Why is Jane pulling shifts into my Manage Shifts Tool?
When we select a
single practitioner from our schedule view,
Jane will use your existing schedule to populate your
Manage Shifts Date Range
. That might be any number of days between 1-7.
⭐ Pro Tip #1: With one staff member selected in your schedule view, and with your
Manage Shifts
tool open, you can click the “
N
” on your keyboard to automatically change your date range to
next
week’s shift schedule. Or, click “
P
” on your keyboard to go to the staff member’s
previous
week’s shift schedule.
We’re full of tips today, so here’s another!
⭐ Pro Tip #2: With the Manage Shifts tool open, type number one on your keyboard, and Jane will populate your Date Range to the first Sunday you have in your Schedule View. Try typing number two all the way up to the number seven to see Jane automatically update the Date Range for you.
Help! My shifts have all disappeared. What happened, and how can I fix this?
Ack…It sounds like you may have saved a blank shift schedule using the Manage Shifts tool. When a blank shift schedule is saved, we are essentially telling Jane to override our existing shifts to match the new shift schedule (
even if your new shift schedule is empty
). Luckily, it’s quite simple to recreate your shift schedule using the Manage Shifts tool. You can visit our guide “
Setting Up Shifts
” to learn how. If you need any assistance with this, please do not hesitate to contact support. Our email is support@janeapp.com.
Why are my appointments displaying in a separate column from my shift?
This can happen when we accidentally apply a new Shift Schedule to the
wrong Room
. Let’s correct this together. First, click on the appointment and review the room it’s assigned to. In our below example, we can see the appointment is assigned to
Room 1
, whereas the shift is assigned to
Room 2.
I’ll need to update my shifts to
Room 1
.
Next, select the staff member within your schedule. Then, let’s open the
Manage Shifts
tool to update the room assignment by clicking on the icon bar. From there, you’ll have the option of selecting the correct room from the drop-down menu. Just be sure that the correct time frame is chosen before saving. Once saved, Jane will move all of the appointments into the updated shift. Easy peasy!
Note:
If your appointment was booked in the wrong room, simply drag and drop your appointment into your new shift and Jane will automatically update the room.
How can I update my shifts so that they are ‘Bookable Online’?
First, let’s select our staff member to the left of the schedule, and ensure that we are in our 7-day view by selecting “
Week
”.
Then, let’s open up our Manage Shifts tool. To update your shifts to bookable online, click on the icon bar and select “Bookable Online”. Then just be sure that you’ve selected the correct time frame and practitioner, and proceed with saving your changes.
Why are some icons in my icon bar blue, while others are black?
Oooh yes, we’re glad you noticed. This is to help users know when a specific setting has been
enabled
.
A
blue
monitor means the shift is bookable online.
A
blue
phone means it’s been marked “contact to book.”
A
blue
house means a room has been assigned to the shift.
A
blue
pencil means a note is present on the shift.
All black icons mean none of the above settings have been created just yet.
Booked vs No Availability language on the Online Booking Site
Ever wondered why some of the shifts on your online booking site say
Booked
and some say
No Availability
? That’s Jane trying to be helpful in differentiating when you are available, you’re all booked up and days you’re just not available.
The
Booked
and
No Availability
text is currently hard-coded and can’t be customized at the moment. There are three scenarios where this text appears:
This text will appear in the middle of a scheduled shift where there are appointments available but all the slots have been booked.
If you add a break in your schedule at a time that’s usually open for appointments.
There are also Online Booking settings that impact how and when this text appears.
How Breaks and Shifts Impact Online Availability:
In the image below, the patient selected the
30-minute massage treatment
. Since Susan has no shift scheduled on Friday or Saturday, Jane is displaying that there is No Availability.
However, for today, there is both a shift and appointments booked in and since the Booked text only appears in the middle of a shift, we can see it peeking through just above that 4:30 PM availability.
Now, lets pop in a shift and a break on Friday. With both of those added to the schedule, Jane is displaying the
Booked
text.
Book by Staff Member vs Book by Treatment:
From an individual’s staff booking page, there are two phrases patients will see;
No Availability
if a shift has not been put in for a particular day, and
Booked
if a shift has been scheduled but has been booked up.
If patients first click on an
appointment type
, rather than a
staff member
, they will see a schedule that shows the availability of all staff who offer that appointment type.
On this version of the online booking page, they will either see open appointment times to book, or
No Availability
on days that no staff member can offer the appointment.
Patients will not see the word
Booked
because Jane is showing the availability of multiple staff members (even if you’re running solo), so there aren’t specific shifts being displayed.
While this isn’t something that we can change, there is an option to update your online booking settings.
Adjusting your Online Booking Settings
To view this, a staff member with
Administrative / All Billing Access
will want to head over to the
Settings
tab, select
Online Booking
in the left sidebar menu and toggle off
Book by Treatment
.
They’ll want to make sure that
Book by Staff
is toggled on though before confirming those changes.
For more details on on the options in this area, you can head over to our
Online Booking: Choosing What Is Offered Online (Locations, Staff, Shifts, Treatments etc) and Individual Staff Preferences
guide.
Help! I deleted a shift but now I can’t see the patients scheduled for that day!
Not to worry, those appointments are still on the schedule! You’ll just want click on the
Shifts
button in the top right corner (so it’s white again) of the
Schedule
tab and voila!
You should see those patient appointments reappear.

Shifts make it easy for Front-Desk Staff to know when the practitioner is available to book in with. Within the administrative schedule, shifts are represented by the blue background you see here. The white space represents the time that staff are unavailable to book in with.
And within the online booking site, clients can book within shifts so long as their Online Booking Options are set to “Bookable Online”. When the shift is set to “Not Bookable Online”, a client will see the shift as “Booked”, or where there is no shift at all, the client will see this “No Availability”.
Note that
Online Booking Options
are set at the time of creating your shifts, and can be changed when needed.
How do I change the gridlines in my schedule?
You can change your schedule gridlines by heading on over to
Settings > Schedule Settings
and then you can select your
Schedule Grid
option from the drop-down menu.
If you are a multidisciplinary clinic and you have differing gridline requirements, we recommend choosing your lowest common denominator. For example, if your Massage Therapist works on a 15-minute gridline, and your Chiropractor works on a 10-minute gridline, we recommend choosing a 5-minute gridline as your lowest common denominator.
To learn more about gridlines,

.
Can I print all existing shifts for multiple staff members for the week?
While there isn’t a direct way to do this, there’s a helpful alternative! You can head over to the
Reports
tab and click on
Hours Scheduled / Booked
. This report shows the scheduled hours for each staff member and the time they spend with patients. Click on the staff member’s name in blue to open a new tab with a printable version of their schedule. There isn’t a way to select multiple staff at a time to appear on this version of the exported report at the moment.
Can I schedule appointments before or after my shift starts/ends?
If you’d like to keep your current shift schedule but still book appointments outside those hours, a staff member with
Full Access
can go to
Settings
>
Schedule Settings
and turn off the
‘Prevent staff from booking outside of shifts’
option.
If your schedule doesn’t cover the time of your appointment (for example, if your appointment is at 8 AM but your schedule starts at 9 AM), you can adjust the
Opening or Closing hours
to include the needed time.
Account Owner or Full Access Required
How do I change my clinic’s opening and closing hours?
To change your clinic’s opening and closing hours, head on over to
Settings > Schedule Settings
and you’ll find your clinic opening hours and closing hours at the top of the page.
We recommend setting your clinic opening hours an hour prior to your shift start time, and your clinic closing hours an hour after your shift end time. This gives Front-Desk Staff a bit more flexibility if they need to book outside of a shift.
Bonus!
✨ It also makes your Online Booking Site look good 😉

I’d like to turn off the ability for my Front-Desk staff to book outside of our scheduled shifts. How do I do that?
Glad you asked! We have a spiffy feature for that hiding within our
Schedule Settings.
Take a look at
this guide
, and let us know if any questions come up!

Account Owner or Full Access Required
Will my clients be able to book within my clinic’s closing and opening hours?
Yes & no… Your clinic’s
closing and opening hours
are the
boundaries
that you can book your
shifts
within. Shifts in Jane are what dictate your availability — and the shifts will need to be made “
Bookable Online
” in order for clients to see your availability online. So, your clients will only be able to book within your clinic’s closing and opening hours if you have created shifts in your schedule.
Are clients able to book appointments outside of shifts?
No, clients are never able to book appointments outside of a shift. On your online booking site, appointments outside of a shift will display as “No Availability” and your clients will not be able to book appointments at those times. If you notice a client booked outside of a shift, it is possible that the appointment was booked administratively by a staff member or there was a shift there at the time of the client booking but the shift has since been removed. If this has come up for you and you’d like help looking into it, please feel free to

2. Manage Shifts 🏡
How do I access Manage Shifts?
In the top right-hand corner of your
Schedule View,
select the drop-down arrow to the right of the “
Shifts
” button. There you’ll find “
Manage Shifts
”. Selecting this will open up your Manage Shifts window.
How do I set the date range for my shifts?
Within the Manage Shifts window, click into each date field to select your
Start Date
and
End Date
from the date picker. You can choose the month and year from the drop-down menus, or the
right
arrow in the top right-hand corner of the date picker to flip through one month at a time:
Why is the date range so important?
Okay, you got me! This hasn’t been a frequently asked question at Jane, but it’s
SO
important, so much so that I decided to ask it myself. The dates chosen from the date pickers will let Jane know the date range of your repeated shift schedule.
It’s also important to be cognizant of the
date range
as you will have the ability to easily
override your shifts that
currently exist within your schedule based on the date range that you’ve chosen.
Let’s show an example:
If I were to proceed with saving the below Empty Shift Schedule, I am telling Jane to remove Zoey’s existing shifts between May 16 - May 22.
❗
A good rule of thumb is:
No Shifts = No Availability (Jane will override your existing shifts)
❗
Do not click ‘
Apply Shift Schedule’
unless you intend to override your shift schedule based on the date range that you’ve chosen.
What is the relation between the
Days of the Week and my Date Range?
The days of the week displayed on the left-hand side represent the days that will be modified within the date range you’ve selected. The date order on the left-hand side is not intended to match the order of the dates chosen within the date picker on the right. Rather, this is your opportunity to add or remove shifts to “Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays etc.” — those days of the week that fall within your date range.
In this quick example, I’m telling Jane to update all of my Mondays - Fridays in my existing shift schedule to 8 AM - 5 PM (between May 12th and Dec 31st), and I’m also telling Jane to remove all shifts from Sundays & Saturdays that fall within this date range as well.
Where can I access my shift settings?
Click into Jane’s handy icon bar, and you’ll find out! 🙂 You’ll have the option of selecting a
room
.
Why are my “
Rooms
” and “
Tags
” not showing up within the Icon bar window?
If you need to work with
Rooms
(to limit treatment availability),
you’ll need to ensure two things:
1. Your
Advanced Scheduling
is
turned on
first in order for these options to be available for you within the icon bar window; and,
2. You have created rooms to choose from.
To learn how to do this, you can click on the links above.
Account Owner or Full Access Required
How do I repeat my shift to other days of the week?
To the right of the shift, you’ll find a little square icon. When you click that, Jane will provide you with the option of copying the shift you’ve created to other days of the week as well. Click
Copy Times
to complete your action.
How do I apply my new shift schedule to multiple practitioners?
With the
Manage Shifts
tool open, check off the names of the staff members to the right-hand side. Jane will
override
those staff members’ existing shift schedules (within the date range you’ve chosen) to match the new shift schedule to the left.
I have a new staff member starting. I’d like their shifts to match an existing shift schedule I’ve already created. How do I do this?
From your schedule view,
select your staff member’s name
whose shifts you’d like copied. Ensure you are in your
seven-day week view
. If you aren’t, simply click “Week” or type the number “7” on your keyboard.
Then, open up Manage Shifts. Jane will know to bring up your selected staff member’s existing shifts. To apply this shift schedule to your new staff member, simply select their name on the left, exactly as we did above. 👆
3. Building on the Basics: Overriding Shift Availability & More! ✂️
Can I use
Manage Shifts
to change the
frequency of my shifts
(i.e., biweekly, etc.)?
The Manage Shifts tool does
not
have the option to specify the frequency of your shift schedule (i.e., biweekly) which means that if a shift is added it will be added
weekly for the given date range.
To learn more about creating a biweekly shift schedule, please visit our
Edit Individual Shifts
guide and scroll down to the last section.
How do I remove a single shift from one practitioner’s schedule?
In this case, we’d recommend using the
Edit Individual Shifts**
tool in Jane. Jump down to the “
Remove Shifts**” section, and let us know if any questions come up!
How do I remove a single shift from multiple practitioner’s schedules?
Starting off in your
schedule view
, click the “
+
” to the right of each staff member’s name whose shift schedule you’d like to change.
Then, with your
Manage Shifts
tool open, you can make things super easy for yourself by
setting your date range to the exact date you’d like removed
from your staff member’s schedules. Then, just be sure that the weekday has no shift populated (if it does, hit the
X).
Finally, check off the staff members this change applies to and select
Apply Shift Schedule.
🔴
Warning:
There should be blue messages (i.e., “
No Sundays available within the selected dates
”) below each day on the left, except for the single day you’ve chosen in your date range.
If not, then it’s a good sign that your date range is not set to just one day.
How do I remove multiple shifts from one practitioner’s schedule?
In this case, Jane’s
Manage Shifts
tool will get the job done faster.
Important first step: Select your staff member within your schedule view first.
Open up your
Manage Shifts
tool,
set the date range to the exact dates you’d like removed
, then be sure that there are
no shifts populating
to the left of your Manage Shifts window. If there are, simply click the
X
to remove them.
Here’s a fresh example after having removed all of my shifts to the left so that Zoey can go on holiday between
December 25th and January 1st.
How do I override multiple shifts from multiple practitioners’ schedules?
Important first step: Hover your mouse over each staff member’s name in your schedule view whose shifts you’d like to override, and click the “+” to the right to select multiple staff members.
Now, with the Manage Shifts window open, you can select your date range in which you’d like your shift schedules removed, select your staff members from your staff list, and remove any shifts to the left. If your shift schedule is
empty
, then
Jane will know to remove all existing shifts within the date range you’ve chosen.
💡
Note
:
Being the overprotective parents that we are, Jane would like to remind your clinic to be extra careful when selecting the date range here. Any shifts within this range will be removed so long as your shift schedule is empty.
In this example below, I am removing
ALL EXISTING SHIFTS
for Amy, Jonathan, and Zoey between
December 25th and January 1st.
🔴
Warning:
If you see
no Shifts populated to the left
of your Manage Shifts window, and you proceed by clicking “
Apply Shift Schedule
”, then you are
overriding your existing schedule
by
removing all existing shifts between this date range.
Jane will open a pop-up box that says, “
Please note: if you already have shifts created, continuing will override those shifts”.
D. Troubleshooting
Why haven’t my shifts populated in my schedule? I just created them in Manage Shifts, but they haven’t appeared.
Let’s give Jane a quick
refresh
. If you’re on a Mac, click Command+R on your keyboard as a quick keyboard shortcut. This will bring up those shifts you’ve just created.
Why haven’t any shifts populated
in my Manage Shifts window
? I know I have shifts scheduled on those dates, but they are not appearing.
There are
two scenarios
where shifts will
not populate
within your
Manage Shifts
window:
No staff members were selected within your schedule view prior to opening the Manage Shifts tool;
More than one staff member was selected within your schedule view
prior to using Manage Shifts. Understandably, Jane cannot show corresponding shifts for more than one staff member for each day of the week.
If either of these two options are chosen, you’ll see an empty shift schedule:
🔴 Please be careful here as saving this window will
override
any existing shifts (by removing them) from your current shift schedule.
Why is Jane pulling shifts into my Manage Shifts Tool?
When we select a
single practitioner from our schedule view,
Jane will use your existing schedule to populate your
Manage Shifts Date Range
. That might be any number of days between 1-7.
⭐ Pro Tip #1: With one staff member selected in your schedule view, and with your
Manage Shifts
tool open, you can click the “
N
” on your keyboard to automatically change your date range to
next
week’s shift schedule. Or, click “
P
” on your keyboard to go to the staff member’s
previous
week’s shift schedule.
We’re full of tips today, so here’s another!
⭐ Pro Tip #2: With the Manage Shifts tool open, type number one on your keyboard, and Jane will populate your Date Range to the first Sunday you have in your Schedule View. Try typing number two all the way up to the number seven to see Jane automatically update the Date Range for you.
Help! My shifts have all disappeared. What happened, and how can I fix this?
Ack…It sounds like you may have saved a blank shift schedule using the Manage Shifts tool. When a blank shift schedule is saved, we are essentially telling Jane to override our existing shifts to match the new shift schedule (
even if your new shift schedule is empty
). Luckily, it’s quite simple to recreate your shift schedule using the Manage Shifts tool. You can visit our guide “
Setting Up Shifts
” to learn how. If you need any assistance with this, please do not hesitate to contact support. Our email is support@janeapp.com.
Why are my appointments displaying in a separate column from my shift?
This can happen when we accidentally apply a new Shift Schedule to the
wrong Room
. Let’s correct this together. First, click on the appointment and review the room it’s assigned to. In our below example, we can see the appointment is assigned to
Room 1
, whereas the shift is assigned to
Room 2.
I’ll need to update my shifts to
Room 1
.
Next, select the staff member within your schedule. Then, let’s open the
Manage Shifts
tool to update the room assignment by clicking on the icon bar. From there, you’ll have the option of selecting the correct room from the drop-down menu. Just be sure that the correct time frame is chosen before saving. Once saved, Jane will move all of the appointments into the updated shift. Easy peasy!
Note:
If your appointment was booked in the wrong room, simply drag and drop your appointment into your new shift and Jane will automatically update the room.
How can I update my shifts so that they are ‘Bookable Online’?
First, let’s select our staff member to the left of the schedule, and ensure that we are in our 7-day view by selecting “
Week
”.
Then, let’s open up our Manage Shifts tool. To update your shifts to bookable online, click on the icon bar and select “Bookable Online”. Then just be sure that you’ve selected the correct time frame and practitioner, and proceed with saving your changes.
Why are some icons in my icon bar blue, while others are black?
Oooh yes, we’re glad you noticed. This is to help users know when a specific setting has been
enabled
.
A
blue
monitor means the shift is bookable online.
A
blue
phone means it’s been marked “contact to book.”
A
blue
house means a room has been assigned to the shift.
A
blue
pencil means a note is present on the shift.
All black icons mean none of the above settings have been created just yet.
Booked vs No Availability language on the Online Booking Site
Ever wondered why some of the shifts on your online booking site say
Booked
and some say
No Availability
? That’s Jane trying to be helpful in differentiating when you are available, you’re all booked up and days you’re just not available.
The
Booked
and
No Availability
text is currently hard-coded and can’t be customized at the moment. There are three scenarios where this text appears:
This text will appear in the middle of a scheduled shift where there are appointments available but all the slots have been booked.
If you add a break in your schedule at a time that’s usually open for appointments.
There are also Online Booking settings that impact how and when this text appears.
How Breaks and Shifts Impact Online Availability:
In the image below, the patient selected the
30-minute massage treatment
. Since Susan has no shift scheduled on Friday or Saturday, Jane is displaying that there is No Availability.
However, for today, there is both a shift and appointments booked in and since the Booked text only appears in the middle of a shift, we can see it peeking through just above that 4:30 PM availability.
Now, lets pop in a shift and a break on Friday. With both of those added to the schedule, Jane is displaying the
Booked
text.
Book by Staff Member vs Book by Treatment:
From an individual’s staff booking page, there are two phrases patients will see;
No Availability
if a shift has not been put in for a particular day, and
Booked
if a shift has been scheduled but has been booked up.
If patients first click on an
appointment type
, rather than a
staff member
, they will see a schedule that shows the availability of all staff who offer that appointment type.
On this version of the online booking page, they will either see open appointment times to book, or
No Availability
on days that no staff member can offer the appointment.
Patients will not see the word
Booked
because Jane is showing the availability of multiple staff members (even if you’re running solo), so there aren’t specific shifts being displayed.
While this isn’t something that we can change, there is an option to update your online booking settings.
Adjusting your Online Booking Settings
To view this, a staff member with
Administrative / All Billing Access
will want to head over to the
Settings
tab, select
Online Booking
in the left sidebar menu and toggle off
Book by Treatment
.
They’ll want to make sure that
Book by Staff
is toggled on though before confirming those changes.
For more details on on the options in this area, you can head over to our
Online Booking: Choosing What Is Offered Online (Locations, Staff, Shifts, Treatments etc) and Individual Staff Preferences
guide.
Help! I deleted a shift but now I can’t see the patients scheduled for that day!
Not to worry, those appointments are still on the schedule! You’ll just want click on the
Shifts
button in the top right corner (so it’s white again) of the
Schedule
tab and voila!
You should see those patient appointments reappear.
