I guess that’s the definition of a class, but we do want to make it clear that if you allow the class to be booked\nonline\n, you will be opening the group up to multiple people who do not know each other.\n💡 Jane Tip: Classes are available on all of Jane’s Pricing Plans, but Online Booking is not available on the Balance Plan.\nUsing this feature for\nOnline Booking\nwill be…\nGreat for things like:\nClinical Pilates\nYoga\nGroup Training\nOpen Support or Counselling Sessions\nAnything where the participants can be total strangers\nNot so great for things like:\nCouples massage\nCouples and family counselling\nAnything where the participants tend to be related to one another\nFor these types of group bookings, you’ll want to use the\nGroup Appointments\nfeature. A Group Appointment typically involves multiple people\nwho know each other\nand are attending the session or receiving the service together. To learn more about Group Appointments,\nclick here\n.\nA note that this is a basic class booking feature and appreciate that there’s always more exciting and fun things we could add to make Jane more helpful to you.  Keep us in the loop with what you’d like to see and why and we’ll make sure we have your vote recorded.\nDiscipline\nFirst thing you might want to do is set up a new Discipline if it falls outside of the disciplines you currently offer, and you want it to display in its own area on your online booking.\nBoth Disciplines and Treatments can be found in your Settings Tab - which you will need Full Access profile to see in your Jane account.\nIf you create a new Discipline, remember, this will be just like the first time you did it - so you’ll have to opt-in the staff members you want to be associated with this class/group booking. A Full-Access Jane user will want to go into each Staff member, under the Profile click Edit, and under the first & last name, click the additional Discipline you want that Staff member to be associated with for Class Bookings.\nMake sure you click the Save button on this screen, either in the top or bottom right.\nIncome Category\nIt can be helpful to separate out your treatments or classes into income categories for easier break down in reporting.  Especially if you have the same type of practitioner offering both types of service.\nHere’s a guide document on\nCreating Income Categories\nCreating a Class\nTo set up a new Class appointment start by\nCreating a New Treatment\nas normal. Choose\nClass Booking\nfrom the first dropdown menu. You’ll see a drop-down menu and then select your\nCapacity\n. If you’re using Online Booking, Jane will display this class online for individuals until that class reaches this capacity.\nI would recommend including the word “class” in the name of the treatment: “Clinical Pilates Class”\nYou can also use the Billing Name to make the invoice and receipt language more clear for insurance billing purposes, and add some information in the Description to populate your online booking site:\nThe price you set will be per class per client.  If you are offering classes as part of a package deal, you can add the class as an eligible item during set up. Learn more about\nSetting up a Package\nhere.\nSo you would set the price to the most common or “drop-in” pricing.\n💡\nJane Tip\nIf you have multiple classes to create that are similar, you can create the first one and then duplicate it to save some time. This is great for something like Pilates classes with the same description and online booking settings but with different lengths or maximum capacities.\nFrom your list of treatments, you can click the\nDuplicate\nbutton next to the original class, edit the settings (make sure to remove the words “Copy of” from the name), and then click\nSave\n. All done!\nAdding a Class to the Schedule\nYou can block off the classes in a staff member’s schedule by choosing it from the treatment list and booking an EMPTY CLASS on their schedule.\nNote\n📝:\nThis is different from a regular appointment. You’ll need to add the class as an empty block to the schedule to add participants and for patients to be able to view the class on the online booking site.\nClick onto the schedule and then in the appointment panel to the right, you’ll choose the class from the\nSelect a Treatment\ndrop-down menu.\nHere’s a gif as well:\nRecurring Classes\nAt this time, classes cannot automatically recur over a set period of time. With that being said, the clinic can create recurring classes by manually inputting them into the schedule.\nTo do this, you can use the\nCopy button\non an already created class, and select a time on the Schedule where you would like to have the class recur.\nNow, we recommend having each Staff member log in to their Jane account and just make sure the class booking shows up. In the example below, we set up a new Discipline called Clinical Pilates Class, created the Class and opted our Staff member Clara Weber into that Class. In Clara’s profile, it’ll look like this:\nAnd to Clara’s clients, it’ll look like this in Online Booking:\nNote - if you are not worried about separating out the classes as their own section on online booking, you can re-name a current discipline, such as Physiotherapy to include both options: Physiotherapy and Clinical Pilates\nDrop-In\nIf the class is first come first serve you will want to open up every class with an open and empty Class Block as shown above.\nSeries\nIf you are booking a series and the participants register once for an entire session (6 weeks for example), you will want to open up just the first date in online booking, and then block off the same time and date with a break for the rest of the sessions.\nOnce your class is at capacity or you have your final list of participants, you can COPY and PASTE that class (including all the participants) into the full length of the session.\nImportant Note\nWhile COPY will duplicate the class and leave the original one in its spot, MOVE will remove it from its spot on the schedule and re-book it elsewhere.  So make sure you’re using the correct workflow and pressing the appropriate button.\nCopy is to book everyone in again, Move is to re-schedule the class to another day and time.\nUpdating an Existing Class\nSince classes are a bit different from regular, one-on-one appointments in Jane, you’ll need to completely remove the class and rebook it with the correct class type. An option here would be to use Jane’s\nDouble Booking\nfeature to tuck in a class at the same time so you can move the participants over to the new class.\nNote\n📝:\nA\nfull access\nuser can head over to the\nSettings\ntab and then click on\nSchedule Settings\n. From there, they can toggle on\nAllow Double Booking\nand make sure to hit the blue\nSave\nbutton to confirm those changes. This is strictly an administrative feature and does not allow patients to double book.\nHead over to the\nSchedule\ntab and hit the letter\n“D”\non your keyboard. You’ll see a notice at the top of the screen, letting you know that Double Booking mode has been turned on.\nJane will shift all the appointments to the left, giving you space to add another appointment at the same time. Click on the space to the right of the class and book and select the class from the options within the\nNew Appointment\npanel.\nIf you remember the participants, you can start adding them now, but if not, you can click on the blue\nBook Appointment\nbutton. This completes the appointment booking, allowing you to click back into the original class on the schedule.\nNow you can click on the old appointment booking to check the list of participants and begin adding them to the new class booking.\nOnce all of the participants are moved over, you can remove the participants from the original booking on the schedule by selecting their name under the\nParticipants\nsection of the\nAppointment Panel:\nNext, Jane will display their details. You can click on the\nCancel/Delete\nbutton and select either\nCancel Appointment\nif you’d like to notify the participant or\nDelete Appointment\nto ensure no notifications are sent out.\nYou’ll need to repeat this process for all the participants before the class can be deleted from the schedule. To quickly toggle back to the previous panel with the list of the class participants, you can click on the\nReturn to Class\nbutton.\nOnce all the participants have been removed from the appointment, you’ll be able to delete the class from the schedule by clicking on the\nRemove\nbutton within the panel:\nJane will display a little pop-up and you’ll just want to click on the blue\nDelete Appointment\nbutton to confirm that change to the schedule.\nOnline Booking\nPatients can book classes by going to the clinic’s\nOnline Booking\nsite and selecting the\nClass\nsession under the selected practitioner. This will display the class bookings on the calendar for the patient to select from:\nThe book-by-treatment view will still show the classes day by day with whoever offers them:\nNeed to create a link or a specific URL for this class? Click on\nyour name\nin the top right corner of your Jane account and select\nOnline Booking\nfrom the dropdown menu.\nNext, select the class on the online booking site.\nCopy the link at the top of your browser. It should be similar to this format:\nhttps://democlinic.janeapp.com/locations/the-village/book#/discipline/3/treatment/5\nCharting\nWhen you pull up the class from your day view, you will be able to click on the class to see the individual participants. And from there clicking on the individual participant will open their chart.\nOnce you have finished charting for one of the clients in the class, you’ll click\nSign\nand confirm that you want to sign this chart entry.\nNext, a pop-up will appear asking if you want to copy this chart to other clients. You have the option of individually selecting clients or using the\nSelect All\nbutton for any\nArrived\nand\nNot Arrived\nparticipants. When you’re ready, click\nCopy Entries\n.\nThis creates a copy of the signed entry in the selected participants’ profiles. You can think of this as a photocopy of a paper file, so if the original entry is changed, you will need to re-share this information across related files for a consistent paper trail. You can learn more about the\nCopy to Client\nfeature\nhere\n.\nReporting\nAll classes will show up on Sales and Compensation reports in the same way that a single one-to-one treatment display.\nA reminder that using a different Income Category can be a great way to filter out the income on some of the reporting.\nVirtual or Online Classes\nAt the moment, all classes can only be held in person. Currently, there isn’t a way to change an existing class to online or to host virtual classes, online classes or class sessions via video for unrelated clients in Jane. If you’d like to have this feature, we’d love to know your thoughts!

I guess that’s the definition of a class, but we do want to make it clear that if you allow the class to be booked\nonline\n, you will be opening the group up to multiple people who do not know each other.\n💡 Jane Tip: Classes are available on all of Jane’s Pricing Plans, but Online Booking is not available on the Balance Plan.\nUsing this feature for\nOnline Booking\nwill be…\nGreat for things like:\nClinical Pilates\nYoga\nGroup Training\nOpen Support or Counselling Sessions\nAnything where the participants can be total strangers\nNot so great for things like:\nCouples massage\nCouples and family counselling\nAnything where the participants tend to be related to one another\nFor these types of group bookings, you’ll want to use the\nGroup Appointments\nfeature. A Group Appointment typically involves multiple people\nwho know each other\nand are attending the session or receiving the service together. To learn more about Group Appointments,\nclick here\n.\nA note that this is a basic class booking feature and appreciate that there’s always more exciting and fun things we could add to make Jane more helpful to you.  Keep us in the loop with what you’d like to see and why and we’ll make sure we have your vote recorded.\nDiscipline\nFirst thing you might want to do is set up a new Discipline if it falls outside of the disciplines you currently offer, and you want it to display in its own area on your online booking.\nBoth Disciplines and Treatments can be found in your Settings Tab - which you will need Full Access profile to see in your Jane account.\nIf you create a new Discipline, remember, this will be just like the first time you did it - so you’ll have to opt-in the staff members you want to be associated with this class/group booking. A Full-Access Jane user will want to go into each Staff member, under the Profile click Edit, and under the first & last name, click the additional Discipline you want that Staff member to be associated with for Class Bookings.\nMake sure you click the Save button on this screen, either in the top or bottom right.\nIncome Category\nIt can be helpful to separate out your treatments or classes into income categories for easier break down in reporting.  Especially if you have the same type of practitioner offering both types of service.\nHere’s a guide document on\nCreating Income Categories\nCreating a Class\nTo set up a new Class appointment start by\nCreating a New Treatment\nas normal. Choose\nClass Booking\nfrom the first dropdown menu. You’ll see a drop-down menu and then select your\nCapacity\n. If you’re using Online Booking, Jane will display this class online for individuals until that class reaches this capacity.\nI would recommend including the word “class” in the name of the treatment: “Clinical Pilates Class”\nYou can also use the Billing Name to make the invoice and receipt language more clear for insurance billing purposes, and add some information in the Description to populate your online booking site:\nThe price you set will be per class per client.  If you are offering classes as part of a package deal, you can add the class as an eligible item during set up. Learn more about\nSetting up a Package\nhere.\nSo you would set the price to the most common or “drop-in” pricing.\n💡\nJane Tip\nIf you have multiple classes to create that are similar, you can create the first one and then duplicate it to save some time. This is great for something like Pilates classes with the same description and online booking settings but with different lengths or maximum capacities.\nFrom your list of treatments, you can click the\nDuplicate\nbutton next to the original class, edit the settings (make sure to remove the words “Copy of” from the name), and then click\nSave\n. All done!\nAdding a Class to the Schedule\nYou can block off the classes in a staff member’s schedule by choosing it from the treatment list and booking an EMPTY CLASS on their schedule.\nNote\n📝:\nThis is different from a regular appointment. You’ll need to add the class as an empty block to the schedule to add participants and for patients to be able to view the class on the online booking site.\nClick onto the schedule and then in the appointment panel to the right, you’ll choose the class from the\nSelect a Treatment\ndrop-down menu.\nHere’s a gif as well:\nRecurring Classes\nAt this time, classes cannot automatically recur over a set period of time. With that being said, the clinic can create recurring classes by manually inputting them into the schedule.\nTo do this, you can use the\nCopy button\non an already created class, and select a time on the Schedule where you would like to have the class recur.\nNow, we recommend having each Staff member log in to their Jane account and just make sure the class booking shows up. In the example below, we set up a new Discipline called Clinical Pilates Class, created the Class and opted our Staff member Clara Weber into that Class. In Clara’s profile, it’ll look like this:\nAnd to Clara’s clients, it’ll look like this in Online Booking:\nNote - if you are not worried about separating out the classes as their own section on online booking, you can re-name a current discipline, such as Physiotherapy to include both options: Physiotherapy and Clinical Pilates\nDrop-In\nIf the class is first come first serve you will want to open up every class with an open and empty Class Block as shown above.\nSeries\nIf you are booking a series and the participants register once for an entire session (6 weeks for example), you will want to open up just the first date in online booking, and then block off the same time and date with a break for the rest of the sessions.\nOnce your class is at capacity or you have your final list of participants, you can COPY and PASTE that class (including all the participants) into the full length of the session.\nImportant Note\nWhile COPY will duplicate the class and leave the original one in its spot, MOVE will remove it from its spot on the schedule and re-book it elsewhere.  So make sure you’re using the correct workflow and pressing the appropriate button.\nCopy is to book everyone in again, Move is to re-schedule the class to another day and time.\nUpdating an Existing Class\nSince classes are a bit different from regular, one-on-one appointments in Jane, you’ll need to completely remove the class and rebook it with the correct class type. An option here would be to use Jane’s\nDouble Booking\nfeature to tuck in a class at the same time so you can move the participants over to the new class.\nNote\n📝:\nA\nfull access\nuser can head over to the\nSettings\ntab and then click on\nSchedule Settings\n. From there, they can toggle on\nAllow Double Booking\nand make sure to hit the blue\nSave\nbutton to confirm those changes. This is strictly an administrative feature and does not allow patients to double book.\nHead over to the\nSchedule\ntab and hit the letter\n“D”\non your keyboard. You’ll see a notice at the top of the screen, letting you know that Double Booking mode has been turned on.\nJane will shift all the appointments to the left, giving you space to add another appointment at the same time. Click on the space to the right of the class and book and select the class from the options within the\nNew Appointment\npanel.\nIf you remember the participants, you can start adding them now, but if not, you can click on the blue\nBook Appointment\nbutton. This completes the appointment booking, allowing you to click back into the original class on the schedule.\nNow you can click on the old appointment booking to check the list of participants and begin adding them to the new class booking.\nOnce all of the participants are moved over, you can remove the participants from the original booking on the schedule by selecting their name under the\nParticipants\nsection of the\nAppointment Panel:\nNext, Jane will display their details. You can click on the\nCancel/Delete\nbutton and select either\nCancel Appointment\nif you’d like to notify the participant or\nDelete Appointment\nto ensure no notifications are sent out.\nYou’ll need to repeat this process for all the participants before the class can be deleted from the schedule. To quickly toggle back to the previous panel with the list of the class participants, you can click on the\nReturn to Class\nbutton.\nOnce all the participants have been removed from the appointment, you’ll be able to delete the class from the schedule by clicking on the\nRemove\nbutton within the panel:\nJane will display a little pop-up and you’ll just want to click on the blue\nDelete Appointment\nbutton to confirm that change to the schedule.\nOnline Booking\nPatients can book classes by going to the clinic’s\nOnline Booking\nsite and selecting the\nClass\nsession under the selected practitioner. This will display the class bookings on the calendar for the patient to select from:\nThe book-by-treatment view will still show the classes day by day with whoever offers them:\nNeed to create a link or a specific URL for this class? Click on\nyour name\nin the top right corner of your Jane account and select\nOnline Booking\nfrom the dropdown menu.\nNext, select the class on the online booking site.\nCopy the link at the top of your browser. It should be similar to this format:\nhttps://democlinic.janeapp.com/locations/the-village/book#/discipline/3/treatment/5\nCharting\nWhen you pull up the class from your day view, you will be able to click on the class to see the individual participants. And from there clicking on the individual participant will open their chart.\nOnce you have finished charting for one of the clients in the class, you’ll click\nSign\nand confirm that you want to sign this chart entry.\nNext, a pop-up will appear asking if you want to copy this chart to other clients. You have the option of individually selecting clients or using the\nSelect All\nbutton for any\nArrived\nand\nNot Arrived\nparticipants. When you’re ready, click\nCopy Entries\n.\nThis creates a copy of the signed entry in the selected participants’ profiles. You can think of this as a photocopy of a paper file, so if the original entry is changed, you will need to re-share this information across related files for a consistent paper trail. You can learn more about the\nCopy to Client\nfeature\nhere\n.\nReporting\nAll classes will show up on Sales and Compensation reports in the same way that a single one-to-one treatment display.\nA reminder that using a different Income Category can be a great way to filter out the income on some of the reporting.\nVirtual or Online Classes\nAt the moment, all classes can only be held in person. Currently, there isn’t a way to change an existing class to online or to host virtual classes, online classes or class sessions via video for unrelated clients in Jane. If you’d like to have this feature, we’d love to know your thoughts!
