AI Scribe introduces the
Smart SOAP Note
chart part that uses a customizable prompt to summarize an audio recording of an appointment so you can focus more on your patients and less on note-taking.
Let’s talk about AI and privacy. AI Scribe is HIPAA, PIPEDA and PHIPA compliant. Your data is not used to train AI models. You’re in control when it comes to using AI solutions in Jane, and you can read more about our
AI principles here
.
📣
Jane tip
: This feature uses an audio recording of a session, either uploaded to a chart or recorded directly in Jane. The audio is then processed by a trusted and compliant third-party using AI. For best practices for getting consent to record audio,
reach out to your regulatory body
as guidance can differ between disciplines and regions. If it’s in line with their recommendations, you could use the
consents section of your intake forms
.
What can this feature do right now?
You can add a Smart SOAP Note chart part to a template and edit the prompt that tells Jane what to summarize from your audio.
You can add a Smart SOAP Note chart part to a single chart entry and use the default prompt.
You can upload an audio file or record audio directly in Jane for your Smart SOAP Note to summarize.
A
Full Access user
can set a clinic-wide deletion policy for recordings.
AI Scribe is currently only available to clinics in the
US
and
Canada
🇺🇲🇨🇦.
What’s coming next?
More sample transcripts
: When you edit your Smart SOAP Note’s prompt, you can test it out with sample transcripts in Jane. There are currently only two sample transcripts so we are working to add more to make it easier to test your prompts.
Let’s get started!

A Full Access user can head to
Settings
>
AI Scribe
and this is where you can add and remove subscriptions for staff profiles.
Each subscription is $15 a month per staff profile
.
Adding a Smart SOAP Note to a chart entry
You can add a Smart SOAP Note to a chart entry without creating a template.
To add your Smart SOAP Note to a single chart, head to your patient’s chart, click
New Chart Entry
and select Smart SOAP Note.
You can edit the default prompt, but you won’t have the option to test your prompt with a sample transcript the way you would if you added this chart part to a template rather than a single chart entry. Instead, you can upload or record audio to see how your prompt performs.
Check out the
prompts section
of this guide to learn more.
Using a Smart SOAP Note in a template
Start by heading to your staff profile and selecting
Templates
under your name.
Next, click the
New template
button to create a new one or click
Edit
next to an existing one.
Click the
Add Item
button and select
Smart SOAP Note
from the list.
Now you can move on to editing your prompt.
Prompts
Your Smart SOAP Note prompt lets Jane know what information from the audio recording should be included in the Smart SOAP Note summary.
Each note has a default prompt which we encourage you to edit and experiment with. You can even use this chart part for something that isn’t related to a SOAP at all like a doctor’s note, for example.
💡
Jane tip
: Thanks to our beta users, we have compiled some
sample prompts for you to try
.
You can click directly into the
Prompt
field to edit.
Prompt Snippets
You can build or add to your prompt using our Prompt Snippets. Under the
Prompts
field, you can click the blue text that reads
Show Prompt Snippets
.
Clicking on a snippet will add some prompt text to the bottom of your Prompt field. It won’t overwrite any of the current text, so you’ll need to highlight any text you don’t want to keep and delete it so things don’t get cluttered.
Testing your prompt in a template
If you’re editing your Smart SOAP Note in a template, you can test your prompt by clicking the
Generate
button. Jane will use a sample transcript so you can see how your prompt works. Right now you can choose a sample transcript for a physio or mental health appointment.
When you’re happy with your prompt, click
Save
and add your other Smart SOAP Notes.
Once you’ve finished and saved your template, it’s ready to rock.
Testing your prompt in a single chart entry
When editing your prompt for a single chart entry, keep in mind that you won’t have access to the sample transcript that was originally generated. To see how your new prompt performs, you’ll need to either upload your own audio file or record new audio.
If you don’t like the way your summary turned out and want to test a different prompt using the same audio, you’ll need to download the original recording and create a new chart entry. To download the audio file, click the microphone icon at the top of the chart entry, then select Manage recordings. This will open a panel on the right-hand side of your screen.
From there, click the
three dots
beside your recording and choose
Download
.
Next, you can edit your prompt and then re-upload your audio file to generate a new summary using your updated prompt.
💡
Jane tip
: Just a reminder to delete any PHI or PII from your device if you’ve downloaded the audio file from your chart.
Using another staff member’s template
From the templates area in your staff profile, you can view templates made by other staff members at your clinic.
If you see one you like, we recommend duplicating it so you have your own copy. This way, if the author of the template edits it, their edits won’t affect your copy.
Alternatively, you can just click the toggle next to the template to add it to your list. If the author makes changes to it, it will update for you as well.
Next, let’s move on to

Legacy PlansAI Scribe introduces the
Smart SOAP Note
chart part that uses a customizable prompt to summarize an audio recording of an appointment so you can focus more on your patients and less on note-taking.
Let’s talk about AI and privacy. AI Scribe is HIPAA, PIPEDA and PHIPA compliant. Your data is not used to train AI models. You’re in control when it comes to using AI solutions in Jane, and you can read more about our
AI principles here
.
📣
Jane tip
: This feature uses an audio recording of a session, either uploaded to a chart or recorded directly in Jane. The audio is then processed by a trusted and compliant third-party using AI. For best practices for getting consent to record audio,
reach out to your regulatory body
as guidance can differ between disciplines and regions. If it’s in line with their recommendations, you could use the
consents section of your intake forms
.
What can this feature do right now?
You can add a Smart SOAP Note chart part to a template and edit the prompt that tells Jane what to summarize from your audio.
You can add a Smart SOAP Note chart part to a single chart entry and use the default prompt.
You can upload an audio file or record audio directly in Jane for your Smart SOAP Note to summarize.
A
Full Access user
can set a clinic-wide deletion policy for recordings.
AI Scribe is currently only available to clinics in the
US
and
Canada
🇺🇲🇨🇦.
What’s coming next?
More sample transcripts
: When you edit your Smart SOAP Note’s prompt, you can test it out with sample transcripts in Jane. There are currently only two sample transcripts so we are working to add more to make it easier to test your prompts.
Let’s get started!

Using another staff member’s template
Opting into AI Scribe
A Full Access user can head to
Settings
>
AI Scribe
and this is where you can add and remove subscriptions for staff profiles.
Each subscription is $15 a month per staff profile
.
Adding a Smart SOAP Note to a chart entry
You can add a Smart SOAP Note to a chart entry without creating a template.
To add your Smart SOAP Note to a single chart, head to your patient’s chart, click
New Chart Entry
and select Smart SOAP Note.
You can edit the default prompt, but you won’t have the option to test your prompt with a sample transcript the way you would if you added this chart part to a template rather than a single chart entry. Instead, you can upload or record audio to see how your prompt performs.
Check out the
prompts section
of this guide to learn more.
Using a Smart SOAP Note in a template
Start by heading to your staff profile and selecting
Templates
under your name.
Next, click the
New template
button to create a new one or click
Edit
next to an existing one.
Click the
Add Item
button and select
Smart SOAP Note
from the list.
Now you can move on to editing your prompt.
Prompts
Your Smart SOAP Note prompt lets Jane know what information from the audio recording should be included in the Smart SOAP Note summary.
Each note has a default prompt which we encourage you to edit and experiment with. You can even use this chart part for something that isn’t related to a SOAP at all like a doctor’s note, for example.
💡
Jane tip
: Thanks to our beta users, we have compiled some
sample prompts for you to try
.
You can click directly into the
Prompt
field to edit.
Prompt Snippets
You can build or add to your prompt using our Prompt Snippets. Under the
Prompts
field, you can click the blue text that reads
Show Prompt Snippets
.
Clicking on a snippet will add some prompt text to the bottom of your Prompt field. It won’t overwrite any of the current text, so you’ll need to highlight any text you don’t want to keep and delete it so things don’t get cluttered.
Testing your prompt in a template
If you’re editing your Smart SOAP Note in a template, you can test your prompt by clicking the
Generate
button. Jane will use a sample transcript so you can see how your prompt works. Right now you can choose a sample transcript for a physio or mental health appointment.
When you’re happy with your prompt, click
Save
and add your other Smart SOAP Notes.
Once you’ve finished and saved your template, it’s ready to rock.
Testing your prompt in a single chart entry
When editing your prompt for a single chart entry, keep in mind that you won’t have access to the sample transcript that was originally generated. To see how your new prompt performs, you’ll need to either upload your own audio file or record new audio.
If you don’t like the way your summary turned out and want to test a different prompt using the same audio, you’ll need to download the original recording and create a new chart entry. To download the audio file, click the microphone icon at the top of the chart entry, then select Manage recordings. This will open a panel on the right-hand side of your screen.
From there, click the
three dots
beside your recording and choose
Download
.
Next, you can edit your prompt and then re-upload your audio file to generate a new summary using your updated prompt.
💡
Jane tip
: Just a reminder to delete any PHI or PII from your device if you’ve downloaded the audio file from your chart.
Using another staff member’s template
From the templates area in your staff profile, you can view templates made by other staff members at your clinic.
If you see one you like, we recommend duplicating it so you have your own copy. This way, if the author of the template edits it, their edits won’t affect your copy.
Alternatively, you can just click the toggle next to the template to add it to your list. If the author makes changes to it, it will update for you as well.
Next, let’s move on to
