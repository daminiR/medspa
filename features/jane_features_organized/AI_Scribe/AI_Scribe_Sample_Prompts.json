Don’t worry, we can help! We’ve collected some prompts from our beta testers for our AI Scribe experimental feature and you can try them out below.\nNeed a refresher on how to use AI Scribe?\nCheck out our guide\n.\nHow to edit your prompt\nPrompt Snippets\nTips & tricks\nSample prompts\nHow to edit your prompt\nThe default AI Scribe prompt is set up to create SOAP notes but can be customized to suit your needs. We encourage you to get creative with them!\nEditing a template\nTo edit or change the prompt in your AI Scribe template, head to your\nStaff profile\nand select\nTemplates\nunder your name.\nNext, you can either create a new template or choose an existing one. If you’re creating a new template, click\nAdd Item\nand add the\nSmart SOAP Note\nchart part.\nClick on the\nSmart SOAP Note\nto edit it and now you can edit or completely change the test in the\nPrompt\nfield.\nEditing a single chart entry\nTo edit a prompt for a single chart entry, you can head to the patient’s chart, click the three dots in the upper right, and select the pencil icon.\nPrompt Snippets\nYou can build or add to your prompt using our Prompt Snippets. Under the\nPrompts\nfield, you can click the blue text that reads\nShow Prompt Snippets\n.\nClicking on a snippet will add some prompt text to the bottom of your\nPrompt\nfield. It won’t overwrite any of the current text, so you’ll need to highlight any text you don’t want to keep and delete it so things don’t get cluttered.\nTips & tricks\nDon’t hesitate to tinker around with your prompt. Take notes when you review what AI Scribe produces and notice patterns so you can tweak your prompt as needed. If AI Scribe’s output often includes “no mention of muscle soreness”, for example, then you can tweak your prompt to say, “only include muscle soreness when mentioned”.\nInclude in your prompt any modalities you are practicing, or regulations you are bound to follow.\nTry dictation! If you’d rather recap your session in your own words, press that record button and dictate your findings.\nRemember, AI Scribe is fantastic,\nbut\nit’s not perfect. You’ll need to review its output.\nSample Prompts\n▶ General Prompt\nSubjective\nA comprehensive subjective section captures detailed information about the patient's symptoms, presenting problems and functional status.

Don’t worry, we can help! We’ve collected some prompts from our beta testers for our AI Scribe experimental feature and you can try them out below.\nNeed a refresher on how to use AI Scribe?\nCheck out our guide\n.\nHow to edit your prompt\nPrompt Snippets\nTips & tricks\nSample prompts\nHow to edit your prompt\nThe default AI Scribe prompt is set up to create SOAP notes but can be customized to suit your needs. We encourage you to get creative with them!\nEditing a template\nTo edit or change the prompt in your AI Scribe template, head to your\nStaff profile\nand select\nTemplates\nunder your name.\nNext, you can either create a new template or choose an existing one. If you’re creating a new template, click\nAdd Item\nand add the\nSmart SOAP Note\nchart part.\nClick on the\nSmart SOAP Note\nto edit it and now you can edit or completely change the test in the\nPrompt\nfield.\nEditing a single chart entry\nTo edit a prompt for a single chart entry, you can head to the patient’s chart, click the three dots in the upper right, and select the pencil icon.\nPrompt Snippets\nYou can build or add to your prompt using our Prompt Snippets. Under the\nPrompts\nfield, you can click the blue text that reads\nShow Prompt Snippets\n.\nClicking on a snippet will add some prompt text to the bottom of your\nPrompt\nfield. It won’t overwrite any of the current text, so you’ll need to highlight any text you don’t want to keep and delete it so things don’t get cluttered.\nTips & tricks\nDon’t hesitate to tinker around with your prompt. Take notes when you review what AI Scribe produces and notice patterns so you can tweak your prompt as needed. If AI Scribe’s output often includes “no mention of muscle soreness”, for example, then you can tweak your prompt to say, “only include muscle soreness when mentioned”.\nInclude in your prompt any modalities you are practicing, or regulations you are bound to follow.\nTry dictation! If you’d rather recap your session in your own words, press that record button and dictate your findings.\nRemember, AI Scribe is fantastic,\nbut\nit’s not perfect. You’ll need to review its output.\nSample Prompts\n▶ General Prompt\nSubjective\nA comprehensive subjective section captures detailed information about the patient's symptoms, presenting problems and functional status. It should also include their pain behaviour, symptom aggravating and easing factors, feelings, concerns, beliefs, previous treatment, expectations, relevant medical history and short and long-term goals. This section reflects the patient's perspective and narrative, providing a context for the clinician's assessment and planning.\nObjective\nAn exemplary objective section includes the clinician's unbiased observations and measurable data. This encompasses findings from physical examinations, diagnostic tests, vital signs, and any treatments or interventions performed during the visit. This section should be clear and factual, focusing on tangible and observable data.\nAssessment\nA thorough assessment section synthesizes the subjective and objective findings to provide a diagnosis or clinical impression.
