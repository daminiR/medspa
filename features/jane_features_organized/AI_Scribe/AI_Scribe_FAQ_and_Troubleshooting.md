Settings
>
AI Scribe
to opt in staff profiles.
Please note that this feature is currently only available for clinics in Canada & the US 🇨🇦 🇺🇲
Is there a cost for this feature?
Yes, this feature is an optional add-on available for $15 per user, per month and you can cancel at any time.
What happens if I sign up or cancel partway through the month?
If you sign up for AI Scribe partway through the month, your $15 monthly charge will be prorated. If you change your mind and cancel partway through the month, you will be credited for the remainder of the month you paid for.
Do all practitioners at a clinic have to opt in to use this feature?
No, staff profiles can be opted in individually in
Settings > AI Scribe
.
Where can I learn more about Jane’s use of AI?
Our
AI principles guide
is a great place to start. It goes into detail about what our guiding principles are when creating AI-powered solutions for clinics. And of course, if you have any questions, you can always reach out at
support@jane.app
.
How is AI Scribe different from other AI scribes?
Great question! AI Scribe is special in a couple of ways:
Fully integrated into Jane so you don’t have to work out of multiple platforms to create templates, record audio, sign, and store your charts.
Secure and responsibly built with Jane’s AI Principles in mind.
Improves every day with feedback from you and our beta testers (thank you!). 💙
Is my data used to train AI models?
No, your data is not used to train AI models. You can read more about our
AI Principles here
.
Is AI Scribe HIPAA, PIPEDA or PHIPA compliant?
You bet it is! Jane (including AI Scribe) is HIPAA, PIPEDA and PHIPA compliant. Recordings made from within Jane are secure and we recommend recording directly in Jane for this reason. If you do record outside of Jane and then upload your recordings, we recommend avoiding using your personal device if possible.
Customizing Prompts and Templates
How do I edit my prompts?
You can edit your prompts for a
single chart entry
, or in a
template
.
To edit prompts in a
template
, head to your staff profile, click Templates under your name and click Edit next to your chart template. From here, you can edit your prompts.
💡
Jane tip
: Heads up, when you edit the chart template, that edit will take effect for other staff who are using that shared template. Each staff member can
duplicate a shared template
to have their own copy.
To edit a prompt for a
single chart entry
, you can head to the chart, click the three dots in the upper right, and select the pencil icon.
Next, you can edit the prompt in the
Prompt Field
and save your changes. If you used a template for this chart entry, the prompt in the template won’t change.
Do I have to use the prompts provided in this guide?
No, you can add your own prompts and experiment with what works best. Some folks use prompts that aren’t even related to SOAP notes, though SOAP notes are the intended use of this feature. We encourage you to try things out and see what works for you.
Can I create templates that auto-populate from previous clinical notes?
No
, Jane doesn’t currently have a feature that can automatically pull data from previous chart entries to populate new clinical notes.
For practitioners who want to maintain continuity between visits, we recommend
duplicating the previous chart entry
as a starting point. This approach allows you to preserve important information from the patient’s last visit while only needing to update or add new details relevant to the current appointment.
Can I use AI Scribe for only some parts of the note?
Yes. Some folks prefer to use AI Scribe for subjective content and add objective notes manually. Once you’re finished recording or uploading your recording, you can edit and add to your chart.
Uploading and Recording
Can I upload multiple audio files at the same time?
No, you can only upload one file at a time. When a file is uploading, you’ll see the banner along the top of the page so you’ll know right away when your file is finished and you can upload another.
Can I upload multiple files to one chart?
Yes, you can record and add multiple audio files to one chart. They will need to be added one at a time, and each audio file or recording will be summarized in the note fields underneath the text that’s already been added. Nothing gets overwritten.
In the example below, you can see how the text for each recording gets added to the bottom of the chart note.
Can I navigate away from the charting area while a file is uploading?
Yes, and you’ll still see the banner with a link to view the chart entry once it’s finished.
When recording directly in Jane, can I pause the recording if I want to avoid recording personal information?
While information uploaded to Jane is secure, you can definitely pause the recording to avoid capturing personal information or any other information you don’t want to include in your chart draft.
When recording directly in Jane, you’ll see a banner with an option to pause and resume the recording under the top blue bar in Jane. When you want to end your recording, don’t forget to click the
Finish
button to save it.
What file types are supported?
You can upload any of the following file types: mp3, mp4, wav, m4a, OGG, and webm.
What is the maximum file size and how long can my recording be?
The maximum file size is 200MB. When you’re recording directly in Jane, you will get a warning at the 80-minute mark, and your recording will finish at the 90-minute mark.
Only my voice is being recorded, not my patient’s or client’s. What can I do?
Jane doesn’t do any post-processing of your audio, so the final recording will include everything that was picked up by your microphone.
If you are recording your voice and your patient’s, then we recommend positioning your microphone with a clear line of sight to yourself and your patient.
If you’re using a headset, that often has a directional microphone designed to pick up the wearer’s voice but not the voices of anyone nearby, so we wouldn’t recommend headsets unless you’re only recording your voice. In a pinch, you can access Jane on your phone and use your phone’s built-in microphone.
Can I upload a recording of a group appointment?
Currently, AI Scribe isn’t as accurate with audio of multiple patients, so we recommend either sticking with dictation from the practitioner, or a conversation between one patient and their practitioner.
Does it work for online appointments?
Great question! The tricky part about online appointments is getting a recording of both the patient and practitioner, since they’re not in the same room. If you can record both the voice of the practitioner and patient in the session, then you can try uploading it to see what happens, but this is not a workflow that has been extensively tested.
Will I see the banner if another practitioner is uploading a file?
No, you’ll only see the banner when you are uploading a file.
Can I record myself dictating, instead of an actual appointment?
Yes, you can! You can follow the same workflow for recording or uploading audio of your dictation.
How can I delete the audio file from Jane?
Click on the
microphone icon
at the top of the chart entry, followed by
Manage recordings
.
Click the
three dots
to the right of the recording date and time, followed by
Delete
.
NOTE: When a recording is deleted, it’s immediately removed from the clinic account and no longer accessible. A copy remains in Jane’s secure backup servers for a short time, but archived recordings are permanently deleted after one week.
Can I set up recordings to auto delete?
Yes, a user with
Full Access
can set up a
Recording deletion policy
for the whole clinic. To set this up, head to
Settings
>
AI Scribe
and scroll down to the
Recording deletion policy
area.
You can choose between keeping files indefinitely, deleting files immediately after successfully generating a chart entry, or deleting the files after a set number of days.
Make sure to save your changes when you’re finished. The policy will apply to all recordings by all practitioners at the clinic.
Technical Issues & Troubleshooting
What do I do if my file has been processing for longer than 5 minutes and seems stuck?
In this case, try reloading Jane to get things moving again.
What happens if my internet connection gets interrupted mid-recording?
Even if your internet connection is lost, you can continue to record. When you’re finished recording, and your internet connection has been restored, you may see a red banner that reads “An error occurred uploading your audio”.
Don’t worry, simply head to your chart, click the microphone icon and select
Manage recordings
. Click the
Retry
button and your audio file should upload correctly.
What do I do when I see a failed to upload error?
In this case, please click on the
Retry Upload
from the pop-up banner, and the audio should be uploaded.
Click on the
microphone icon
near the top of the chart entry, followed by
Manage Recordings
.
Under the recording, you’ll see an option to
Retry
the upload.
You can recover the audio file from here provided you haven’t refreshed the page. Unfortunately, if the page has been refreshed since the error occurred, the file is lost, as we never received the uploaded audio to retrieve.
If you are able to recover the audio file, you can download and re-upload it for AI Scribe to summarize.
What do I do if I see a red “Failed” banner?
This typically means that the audio recording has been uploaded successfully, but not processed into a transcript.
We recommend opening the patient recordings panel by clicking the microphone dropdown in the chart entry, then selecting Manage Recordings.
Try listening to your recording to make sure your microphone picked up your voice properly. If it did, click the
Retry
button to regenerate the chart note.

Access and Set-Up
How can I access AI Scribe?
A Full Access user can head to
Settings
>
AI Scribe
to opt in staff profiles.
Please note that this feature is currently only available for clinics in Canada & the US 🇨🇦 🇺🇲
Is there a cost for this feature?
Yes, this feature is an optional add-on available for $15 per user, per month and you can cancel at any time.
What happens if I sign up or cancel partway through the month?
If you sign up for AI Scribe partway through the month, your $15 monthly charge will be prorated. If you change your mind and cancel partway through the month, you will be credited for the remainder of the month you paid for.
Do all practitioners at a clinic have to opt in to use this feature?
No, staff profiles can be opted in individually in
Settings > AI Scribe
.
Where can I learn more about Jane’s use of AI?
Our
AI principles guide
is a great place to start. It goes into detail about what our guiding principles are when creating AI-powered solutions for clinics. And of course, if you have any questions, you can always reach out at
support@jane.app
.
How is AI Scribe different from other AI scribes?
Great question! AI Scribe is special in a couple of ways:
Fully integrated into Jane so you don’t have to work out of multiple platforms to create templates, record audio, sign, and store your charts.
Secure and responsibly built with Jane’s AI Principles in mind.
Improves every day with feedback from you and our beta testers (thank you!). 💙
Is my data used to train AI models?
No, your data is not used to train AI models. You can read more about our
AI Principles here
.
Is AI Scribe HIPAA, PIPEDA or PHIPA compliant?
You bet it is! Jane (including AI Scribe) is HIPAA, PIPEDA and PHIPA compliant. Recordings made from within Jane are secure and we recommend recording directly in Jane for this reason. If you do record outside of Jane and then upload your recordings, we recommend avoiding using your personal device if possible.
Customizing Prompts and Templates
How do I edit my prompts?
You can edit your prompts for a
single chart entry
, or in a
template
.
To edit prompts in a
template
, head to your staff profile, click Templates under your name and click Edit next to your chart template. From here, you can edit your prompts.
💡
Jane tip
: Heads up, when you edit the chart template, that edit will take effect for other staff who are using that shared template. Each staff member can
duplicate a shared template
to have their own copy.
To edit a prompt for a
single chart entry
, you can head to the chart, click the three dots in the upper right, and select the pencil icon.
Next, you can edit the prompt in the
Prompt Field
and save your changes. If you used a template for this chart entry, the prompt in the template won’t change.
Do I have to use the prompts provided in this guide?
No, you can add your own prompts and experiment with what works best. Some folks use prompts that aren’t even related to SOAP notes, though SOAP notes are the intended use of this feature. We encourage you to try things out and see what works for you.
Can I create templates that auto-populate from previous clinical notes?
No
, Jane doesn’t currently have a feature that can automatically pull data from previous chart entries to populate new clinical notes.
For practitioners who want to maintain continuity between visits, we recommend
duplicating the previous chart entry
as a starting point. This approach allows you to preserve important information from the patient’s last visit while only needing to update or add new details relevant to the current appointment.
Can I use AI Scribe for only some parts of the note?
Yes. Some folks prefer to use AI Scribe for subjective content and add objective notes manually. Once you’re finished recording or uploading your recording, you can edit and add to your chart.
Uploading and Recording
Can I upload multiple audio files at the same time?
No, you can only upload one file at a time. When a file is uploading, you’ll see the banner along the top of the page so you’ll know right away when your file is finished and you can upload another.
Can I upload multiple files to one chart?
Yes, you can record and add multiple audio files to one chart. They will need to be added one at a time, and each audio file or recording will be summarized in the note fields underneath the text that’s already been added. Nothing gets overwritten.
In the example below, you can see how the text for each recording gets added to the bottom of the chart note.
Can I navigate away from the charting area while a file is uploading?
Yes, and you’ll still see the banner with a link to view the chart entry once it’s finished.
When recording directly in Jane, can I pause the recording if I want to avoid recording personal information?
While information uploaded to Jane is secure, you can definitely pause the recording to avoid capturing personal information or any other information you don’t want to include in your chart draft.
When recording directly in Jane, you’ll see a banner with an option to pause and resume the recording under the top blue bar in Jane. When you want to end your recording, don’t forget to click the
Finish
button to save it.
What file types are supported?
You can upload any of the following file types: mp3, mp4, wav, m4a, OGG, and webm.
What is the maximum file size and how long can my recording be?
The maximum file size is 200MB. When you’re recording directly in Jane, you will get a warning at the 80-minute mark, and your recording will finish at the 90-minute mark.
Only my voice is being recorded, not my patient’s or client’s. What can I do?
Jane doesn’t do any post-processing of your audio, so the final recording will include everything that was picked up by your microphone.
If you are recording your voice and your patient’s, then we recommend positioning your microphone with a clear line of sight to yourself and your patient.
If you’re using a headset, that often has a directional microphone designed to pick up the wearer’s voice but not the voices of anyone nearby, so we wouldn’t recommend headsets unless you’re only recording your voice. In a pinch, you can access Jane on your phone and use your phone’s built-in microphone.
Can I upload a recording of a group appointment?
Currently, AI Scribe isn’t as accurate with audio of multiple patients, so we recommend either sticking with dictation from the practitioner, or a conversation between one patient and their practitioner.
Does it work for online appointments?
Great question! The tricky part about online appointments is getting a recording of both the patient and practitioner, since they’re not in the same room. If you can record both the voice of the practitioner and patient in the session, then you can try uploading it to see what happens, but this is not a workflow that has been extensively tested.
Will I see the banner if another practitioner is uploading a file?
No, you’ll only see the banner when you are uploading a file.
Can I record myself dictating, instead of an actual appointment?
Yes, you can! You can follow the same workflow for recording or uploading audio of your dictation.
How can I delete the audio file from Jane?
Click on the
microphone icon
at the top of the chart entry, followed by
Manage recordings
.
Click the
three dots
to the right of the recording date and time, followed by
Delete
.
NOTE: When a recording is deleted, it’s immediately removed from the clinic account and no longer accessible. A copy remains in Jane’s secure backup servers for a short time, but archived recordings are permanently deleted after one week.
Can I set up recordings to auto delete?
Yes, a user with
Full Access
can set up a
Recording deletion policy
for the whole clinic. To set this up, head to
Settings
>
AI Scribe
and scroll down to the
Recording deletion policy
area.
You can choose between keeping files indefinitely, deleting files immediately after successfully generating a chart entry, or deleting the files after a set number of days.
Make sure to save your changes when you’re finished. The policy will apply to all recordings by all practitioners at the clinic.
Technical Issues & Troubleshooting
What do I do if my file has been processing for longer than 5 minutes and seems stuck?
In this case, try reloading Jane to get things moving again.
What happens if my internet connection gets interrupted mid-recording?
Even if your internet connection is lost, you can continue to record. When you’re finished recording, and your internet connection has been restored, you may see a red banner that reads “An error occurred uploading your audio”.
Don’t worry, simply head to your chart, click the microphone icon and select
Manage recordings
. Click the
Retry
button and your audio file should upload correctly.
What do I do when I see a failed to upload error?
In this case, please click on the
Retry Upload
from the pop-up banner, and the audio should be uploaded.
Click on the
microphone icon
near the top of the chart entry, followed by
Manage Recordings
.
Under the recording, you’ll see an option to
Retry
the upload.
You can recover the audio file from here provided you haven’t refreshed the page. Unfortunately, if the page has been refreshed since the error occurred, the file is lost, as we never received the uploaded audio to retrieve.
If you are able to recover the audio file, you can download and re-upload it for AI Scribe to summarize.
What do I do if I see a red “Failed” banner?
This typically means that the audio recording has been uploaded successfully, but not processed into a transcript.
We recommend opening the patient recordings panel by clicking the microphone dropdown in the chart entry, then selecting Manage Recordings.
Try listening to your recording to make sure your microphone picked up your voice properly. If it did, click the
Retry
button to regenerate the chart note.Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.
