Not sure what to enter into the prompt field on your AI Scribe template? Don’t worry, we can help! We’ve collected some prompts from our beta testers for our AI Scribe experimental feature and you can try them out below.

Sample prompts
How to edit your prompt
The default AI Scribe prompt is set up to create SOAP notes but can be customized to suit your needs. We encourage you to get creative with them!
Editing a template
To edit or change the prompt in your AI Scribe template, head to your
Staff profile
and select
Templates
under your name.
Next, you can either create a new template or choose an existing one. If you’re creating a new template, click
Add Item
and add the
Smart SOAP Note
chart part.
Click on the
Smart SOAP Note
to edit it and now you can edit or completely change the test in the
Prompt
field.
Editing a single chart entry
To edit a prompt for a single chart entry, you can head to the patient’s chart, click the three dots in the upper right, and select the pencil icon.
Prompt Snippets
You can build or add to your prompt using our Prompt Snippets. Under the
Prompts
field, you can click the blue text that reads
Show Prompt Snippets
.
Clicking on a snippet will add some prompt text to the bottom of your
Prompt
field. It won’t overwrite any of the current text, so you’ll need to highlight any text you don’t want to keep and delete it so things don’t get cluttered.
Tips & tricks
Don’t hesitate to tinker around with your prompt. Take notes when you review what AI Scribe produces and notice patterns so you can tweak your prompt as needed. If AI Scribe’s output often includes “no mention of muscle soreness”, for example, then you can tweak your prompt to say, “only include muscle soreness when mentioned”.
Include in your prompt any modalities you are practicing, or regulations you are bound to follow.
Try dictation! If you’d rather recap your session in your own words, press that record button and dictate your findings.
Remember, AI Scribe is fantastic,
but
it’s not perfect. You’ll need to review its output.

At the end of the session, please state something like "if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in contact." After, state "Best regards," and underneath, state the therapist's name and professional designation.

Begin with, 'It sounds like you may have [diagnosis].' Then, briefly explain why you believe this is the case, drawing on key subjective and objective findings from the assessment. Convey any uncertainty with warmth, confidence, and optimism to reassure the patient. Keep the summary brief and to the point.
For 'How long will it take to get better?' please provide the therapist's prognosis for the patient's condition, estimating the total recovery time in weeks or months. Ensure the response conveys optimism and confidence, even when acknowledging any uncertainties.
For ‘Goals’ please outline  1 to 3 of the patient's treatment goals. Include one short-term and long-term goal, with a focus on functional outcomes that align with the patient's personal objectives. For example, consider goals related to return to daily activities or enhanced sports performance. Make sure to tie these goals to the patient's individual circumstances and desired outcomes.
For 'What are the recovery strategies?' Please summarize the recovery strategies, categorizing each element clearly. Begin with education and pain education, followed by specific advice for activity modification and or progressive loading (exercise that slowly becomes more challenging overtime). Include pain management strategies, detailing any manual therapy techniques, dry needling, or the use of ice/heat. Lastly, outline the exercises, specifying the sets and reps. Ensure each strategy is listed on a separate line for easy reference.

For “What is the follow up schedule” please summarize the recommended follow-up schedule for the patient in detail. Start by explicitly stating, 'For Phase 1 of treatment,' and list the specific number of visits per week and the total number of weeks required. Next, write, 'For Phase 2,' and outline the expected visit frequency and duration for this phase. Conclude with, 'To get things started, let's meet once per week for the next 8 weeks.

In a separate paragraph, state the recovery timeline, any prescribed therapies, the patient goals and the follow-up schedule.

AI Scribe: Sample Prompts
24 min readNot sure what to enter into the prompt field on your AI Scribe template? Don’t worry, we can help! We’ve collected some prompts from our beta testers for our AI Scribe experimental feature and you can try them out below.
Need a refresher on how to use AI Scribe?
Check out our guide
.
How to edit your prompt
Prompt Snippets
Tips & tricks
Sample prompts
How to edit your prompt
The default AI Scribe prompt is set up to create SOAP notes but can be customized to suit your needs. We encourage you to get creative with them!
Editing a template
To edit or change the prompt in your AI Scribe template, head to your
Staff profile
and select
Templates
under your name.
Next, you can either create a new template or choose an existing one. If you’re creating a new template, click
Add Item
and add the
Smart SOAP Note
chart part.
Click on the
Smart SOAP Note
to edit it and now you can edit or completely change the test in the
Prompt
field.
Editing a single chart entry
To edit a prompt for a single chart entry, you can head to the patient’s chart, click the three dots in the upper right, and select the pencil icon.
Prompt Snippets
You can build or add to your prompt using our Prompt Snippets. Under the
Prompts
field, you can click the blue text that reads
Show Prompt Snippets
.
Clicking on a snippet will add some prompt text to the bottom of your
Prompt
field. It won’t overwrite any of the current text, so you’ll need to highlight any text you don’t want to keep and delete it so things don’t get cluttered.
Tips & tricks
Don’t hesitate to tinker around with your prompt. Take notes when you review what AI Scribe produces and notice patterns so you can tweak your prompt as needed. If AI Scribe’s output often includes “no mention of muscle soreness”, for example, then you can tweak your prompt to say, “only include muscle soreness when mentioned”.
Include in your prompt any modalities you are practicing, or regulations you are bound to follow.
Try dictation! If you’d rather recap your session in your own words, press that record button and dictate your findings.
Remember, AI Scribe is fantastic,
but
it’s not perfect. You’ll need to review its output.
Sample Prompts
▶ General Prompt
Subjective
A comprehensive subjective section captures detailed information about the patient's symptoms, presenting problems and functional status. It should also include their pain behaviour, symptom aggravating and easing factors, feelings, concerns, beliefs, previous treatment, expectations, relevant medical history and short and long-term goals. This section reflects the patient's perspective and narrative, providing a context for the clinician's assessment and planning.
Objective
An exemplary objective section includes the clinician's unbiased observations and measurable data. This encompasses findings from physical examinations, diagnostic tests, vital signs, and any treatments or interventions performed during the visit. This section should be clear and factual, focusing on tangible and observable data.
Assessment
A thorough assessment section synthesizes the subjective and objective findings to provide a diagnosis or clinical impression. This section should include the clinician's interpretation of the data, differential diagnoses, and the rationale behind the chosen diagnosis. It serves as a bridge between the observed data and the plan of care.
Plan
A well-structured plan section outlines the proposed management and treatment strategies. This includes medication prescriptions, recommended therapies, follow-up appointments, patient education, and any additional diagnostic tests needed. The plan should be clear, actionable, and tailored to the patient's specific needs and conditions.

▶ Feeding Therapy Prompt
Produce a SOAP note as described below for a feeding therapy session for paediatric occupational therapist. Since this is feeding related, pay special attention to any or all information related to food, including names of the foods mentioned, the brand names of the foods, the textures of the foods, the presentation of food, the seating set up, and the child's interactions with the foods. Include timings and schedules.
Subjective
A comprehensive subjective section captures detailed information about the patient's symptoms, presenting problems and functional status. It should also include their pain behaviour, symptom aggravating and easing factors, previous treatment, expectations, relevant medical history and short and long-term goals. This section reflects the patient's and parent's perspective and narrative, providing a context for the clinician's assessment and planning. include anything the parent or caregiver has reported during the session.
