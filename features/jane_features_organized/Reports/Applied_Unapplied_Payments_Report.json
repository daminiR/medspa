An applied history can be viewed at the bottom of an individual payment.\nThis report can be thought of as the aggregate of all applied history line items across all payment methods (including credit memos and gift cards).\nIt is worth clarifying that this report determines which data to display based on when a payment was\napplied\n(applied date, shown on the left-hand side for each applied history item), and\nnot\nbased on when the payment was originally received by the clinics (the received at date). More often that not, these two dates match. But it is not always the case (e.g. account credit).\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the different types of dates in Jane, check out our guide:\nWorking with the Purchase, Invoice, Received At, and Applied Dates\n💡 Note: For consistency with the Billing Summary Report, this report currently excludes any payments applied/unapplied to tips. To review any tips collected within the period, check out the dedicated\nTip Report\n.\nAt the top of the report, there is a summary section with three helpful calculations:\nTotal Applied:\nThis is the net total (sum) of collected total column for all applied (positive) and unapplied (negative) line items within the period. This number will always match the applied amounts shown on the\nBilling Summary Report\nwhen the same filters are used.\nTotal Applied to Invoices Within Report Period:\nThe net total for all payments that were applied/unapplied to invoices with a purchase date that falls within the date range set. For example, with a date range set to the month of January:\nTotal all applied/unapplied payments where the purchase date associated within the invoice falls between January 1 and 31.\nTotal Applied to Invoice Outside of Report Period:\nThe net total for all payments that were applied/unapplied to invoices with a purchase date that falls\noutside\nthe date range set. For example, with a date range set to the month of January:\nTotal all applied/unapplied payments where the purchase date associated within the invoice falls before January 1 or after January 31.\nThe sum of the last two calculations will always add up to the total applied value.\n💡 Interested in paying out your practitioners based on when payment is received for one of their services? The dedicated\nCompensation Report\n.\nLike most other reports in Jane, the Applied and Unapplied Payments Report can also be exported to a CSV or Excel file format. The exported version of the report will include all of the information shown in Jane, as well as some additional columns: Invoice Date, Patient GUID, and Income Category.\nFurther Reading:\nApplying and Unapplying a Payment?\nSo what exactly does it mean to apply a payment towards an invoice? We understand that this can be a tricky concept to wrap one’s head around, so here’s a (delicious!) analogy that we find helpful.\nWhen an appointment is arrived or a product is sold, Jane automatically generates an invoice for that item. An invoice can be thought of as an empty container that can hold a payment—  much in the same way a box would hold an assortment of doughnuts 🍩\nDuring the checkout process, Jane records that a payment has been collected from the patient and automatically associates the payment to the invoice. In other words, we are filling up our box with doughnuts. It is this process of applying a payment towards an invoice that officially deems the invoice as fully paid.\nWe can use our example to visualize some other common billing scenarios:\nAn invoice is unpaid (a box with no doughnuts)\nAn invoice is partially paid (a box with some doughnuts, but with room for more)\nA payment is collected, but not allocated towards any invoice (we have doughnuts, but no box)\nIn that last example, payments that have not yet been applied to an invoice will sit on the patient’s profile as an\naccount credit\n. The doughnuts (payments) are resting on a separate cooling rack (patient profile), ready to be distributed to any boxes (invoices) that become available and have some empty room.\nIn some cases it may be appropriate to\nunapply\na payment from an invoice. Often, this is because we may have applied the wrong payment to the invoice (maybe we put jelly doughnuts in the box when they should have been crullers), or we need to make a change to the invoice itself (we used the wrong box size for the order).\nIn these cases, we will want to remove the doughnuts from the box and place them back on the cooling rack until we figure out what to do with them.\nEvery time a doughnut is moved into the box, we are applying a payment to an invoice. And likewise, every time we move a doughnut out from the box, we are unapplying a payment.\nThese are the actions shown in the Applied History for a payment as well the information displayed on the Applied & Unapplied Report.\nFurther Reading: What is the difference between Applied Payments and Transactions?\nTransactions and Applied Payments are two very closely related concepts. Transactions totals for a period can be found on the Billing Summary Report, as well as the (Daily)\nTransactions Report\nTransactions\nrepresent payments that have been collected by the clinic, regardless of whether or not they have been applied to an invoice or not. This total also includes any refunds that may have occurred, where money was returned to the patient. Transactions on their own do not have an income category, discipline, or staff member.\nApplied Payments\non the other hand, represent payments that have put towards invoices. It is possible that the date a payment is applied to an invoice is not the same as the date a payment was originally collected. It is only when a payment has been applied to an invoice when it can assume an income category, discipline, or staff member.\nWhen completing your bookkeeping, a friendly reminder to double check which number is more appropriate for the particular task at hand. While the two values can often seem very similar— and can sometimes equal the same amount on a given day— they are their own distinct calculation.\nHungry for more?

An applied history can be viewed at the bottom of an individual payment.\nThis report can be thought of as the aggregate of all applied history line items across all payment methods (including credit memos and gift cards).\nIt is worth clarifying that this report determines which data to display based on when a payment was\napplied\n(applied date, shown on the left-hand side for each applied history item), and\nnot\nbased on when the payment was originally received by the clinics (the received at date). More often that not, these two dates match. But it is not always the case (e.g. account credit).\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the different types of dates in Jane, check out our guide:\nWorking with the Purchase, Invoice, Received At, and Applied Dates\n💡 Note: For consistency with the Billing Summary Report, this report currently excludes any payments applied/unapplied to tips. To review any tips collected within the period, check out the dedicated\nTip Report\n.\nAt the top of the report, there is a summary section with three helpful calculations:\nTotal Applied:\nThis is the net total (sum) of collected total column for all applied (positive) and unapplied (negative) line items within the period. This number will always match the applied amounts shown on the\nBilling Summary Report\nwhen the same filters are used.\nTotal Applied to Invoices Within Report Period:\nThe net total for all payments that were applied/unapplied to invoices with a purchase date that falls within the date range set. For example, with a date range set to the month of January:\nTotal all applied/unapplied payments where the purchase date associated within the invoice falls between January 1 and 31.\nTotal Applied to Invoice Outside of Report Period:\nThe net total for all payments that were applied/unapplied to invoices with a purchase date that falls\noutside\nthe date range set. For example, with a date range set to the month of January:\nTotal all applied/unapplied payments where the purchase date associated within the invoice falls before January 1 or after January 31.\nThe sum of the last two calculations will always add up to the total applied value.\n💡 Interested in paying out your practitioners based on when payment is received for one of their services? The dedicated\nCompensation Report\n.\nLike most other reports in Jane, the Applied and Unapplied Payments Report can also be exported to a CSV or Excel file format. The exported version of the report will include all of the information shown in Jane, as well as some additional columns: Invoice Date, Patient GUID, and Income Category.\nFurther Reading:\nApplying and Unapplying a Payment?\nSo what exactly does it mean to apply a payment towards an invoice? We understand that this can be a tricky concept to wrap one’s head around, so here’s a (delicious!) analogy that we find helpful.\nWhen an appointment is arrived or a product is sold, Jane automatically generates an invoice for that item. An invoice can be thought of as an empty container that can hold a payment—  much in the same way a box would hold an assortment of doughnuts 🍩\nDuring the checkout process, Jane records that a payment has been collected from the patient and automatically associates the payment to the invoice. In other words, we are filling up our box with doughnuts. It is this process of applying a payment towards an invoice that officially deems the invoice as fully paid.\nWe can use our example to visualize some other common billing scenarios:\nAn invoice is unpaid (a box with no doughnuts)\nAn invoice is partially paid (a box with some doughnuts, but with room for more)\nA payment is collected, but not allocated towards any invoice (we have doughnuts, but no box)\nIn that last example, payments that have not yet been applied to an invoice will sit on the patient’s profile as an\naccount credit\n. The doughnuts (payments) are resting on a separate cooling rack (patient profile), ready to be distributed to any boxes (invoices) that become available and have some empty room.\nIn some cases it may be appropriate to\nunapply\na payment from an invoice. Often, this is because we may have applied the wrong payment to the invoice (maybe we put jelly doughnuts in the box when they should have been crullers), or we need to make a change to the invoice itself (we used the wrong box size for the order).\nIn these cases, we will want to remove the doughnuts from the box and place them back on the cooling rack until we figure out what to do with them.\nEvery time a doughnut is moved into the box, we are applying a payment to an invoice. And likewise, every time we move a doughnut out from the box, we are unapplying a payment.\nThese are the actions shown in the Applied History for a payment as well the information displayed on the Applied & Unapplied Report.\nFurther Reading: What is the difference between Applied Payments and Transactions?\nTransactions and Applied Payments are two very closely related concepts. Transactions totals for a period can be found on the Billing Summary Report, as well as the (Daily)\nTransactions Report\nTransactions\nrepresent payments that have been collected by the clinic, regardless of whether or not they have been applied to an invoice or not. This total also includes any refunds that may have occurred, where money was returned to the patient. Transactions on their own do not have an income category, discipline, or staff member.\nApplied Payments\non the other hand, represent payments that have put towards invoices. It is possible that the date a payment is applied to an invoice is not the same as the date a payment was originally collected. It is only when a payment has been applied to an invoice when it can assume an income category, discipline, or staff member.\nWhen completing your bookkeeping, a friendly reminder to double check which number is more appropriate for the particular task at hand. While the two values can often seem very similar— and can sometimes equal the same amount on a given day— they are their own distinct calculation.\nHungry for more?
