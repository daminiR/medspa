What’s the Summary Report?
The Summary report provides a general overview of the day-to-day financial information of your clinic.
You can find this report by heading to
Reports > Summary
Using the Summary report, you’ll be able to contrast the amount that was
invoiced during the period
, and the
amounts applied to invoices
during the same time across various categories.  It can be useful for tracking who is paying you (we like these people!), and particularly helpful with tracking taxes invoiced and/or collected.  Users can run this report for any time period, and filter the results by any staff member.

What’s included in the Summary Report?
There are up to 9 different sections that can be found in the Summary report:
Sales by Location
shows the amounts invoiced and payments applied by each location of your clinic.
Sales Breakdown
compares the amounts invoiced and payments applied for treatments and products.
Note:
The applied and invoice values of both the Sales by Location and Sales Breakdown will be the same, since they are both breakdowns of the same information (just displayed differently).
Income
lists all your income sources (patients and various insurers) and provides the total amounts invoiced and payments applied for each one.
Tax
shows the total amounts invoiced and payments applied for all kinds of tax.
For our Canadian clinics looking for more information on tax reporting, hop into the following guide:
Employee Contractor Taxes with Jane
Transactions
gives you the total applied for every different payment method.
Credit
lists any new credit created during the reporting period, and any past credit used during the reporting period.
Note: The “Credit” area of the Billing Summary report is interested in whether there was a
net change
in credit for a particular day. If a credit was created, then used on the same day, no overall net change was experienced, and it will not display on the report.
Refunds
shows the total amount in refunds processed during the reporting period.
Some sections and/or subsections that may show up depending on what was processed in the clinic include:
Gift Cards
which will summarize the dollar amount of gift cards being loaded & redeemed (used as payment for services or products).
New Payments with Balance Remaining (as of Today)
are new payments received that have balances remaining
as of today
(if there is no date range selected for your Summary report) and the balance remaining is an
account credit
.
New Credit Memos
are any new credit memo created during the reporting period.
Past Payments Applied
is related to the New Payments with Balance Remaining, except it’s referring to old payments received
prior to the time period you’re filtering
for
but
were applied during your filtered time period
.
Past Credit Memos Applied
are previously generated credit memos (outside of the filtered date range) that were
applied during your filtered date range
.
What are the Invoiced vs. Applied Amounts?
Let’s review how Jane is calculating the “
Invoiced
” totals and the “
Applied
” totals for this report, as they are actually displaying different bits of information. The
Invoiced total
shows total amount of invoices generated within the date range (some invoices may be unpaid). The
Applied total
shows total invoices
paid
within date range (this might include new payments being applied to old invoices).
A bit more on this:
you may generally settle up patient invoices after completing their session, making the date the invoices were generated and the date the payments are collected or “applied” occur on the same day. However, there are circumstances where the invoiced and applied totals may fall on different dates, for example— a client comes in for an appointment but does not settle up their invoice until a later date, or a patient pre-pays for an appointment that hasn’t happened yet. These are both examples of when the invoiced and applied payment totals do not fall on the same date, and will not match on the report.
Where can I explore the numbers in this report in more detail?
If you’d like to explore where the numbers in the Summary report are coming from, you’ll be able to take a look at all of the individual invoices that have been generated (the
Invoiced
totals) by working with the
Sales Report
, and for a list of the payments applied by practitioner, you can view the
Compensation report
. To see a list of all of the payments collected by the clinic, view the
Transaction Report
.
Summary, Sales, and Compensation Report Love Triangle
These reports represent Jane’s love triangle in the Reports section ❤️
The numbers in the Sales and Compensation reports make up what you see displayed in the Billing Summary report.
You’ll notice that the
Invoiced
Total on the Summary Report is going to match the Total Invoiced amount from the Sales report run in the same date range. There is no need to worry about making sure the two numbers match up, the Sales report is simply a way to view a detailed list of invoices run in the same date range.
The
Applied
Total on the Summary report plus Total Tips matches the Collected Total of the Compensation Report, since the Collected Total includes Tips in its calculation. Again, you do not need to worry about the below calculation, as Jane is doing the math for you.
Here’s an example, of the staff member Susan Lo’s Summary Report:
Applied total plus tips on the Summary Report: $28.50 + $4.28 = $32.78
Matches Collected total of Susan Lo’s Compensation Report:
Summary Report Example Scenario 📚
Deb at the Demo Clinic is starting a brand new day!
In the morning, Deb runs the
Billing Summary Report
and all totals are
$0.00.
The first patient of the day has arrived, and Deb at the front desk clicks the “Arrive” button to check them in. She has now created an invoice for a
$90.00
Massage visit.
When Deb refreshes the Billing Summary Report (by clicking Load a Fresh Copy), the Invoiced column now shows
$90.00
. Each time that an appointment in Jane is “Arrived,” or a product is invoiced to a patient account, it will appear under the “Invoiced” column, regardless of if the appointment or product has been paid.
We can also see the massage is categorized under “Treatment Income” in the Sales Breakdown:
And categorized as “Patient” income as the Income Source.
The massage visit is now complete and Deb collects payment by Visa for the massage appointment, marking the invoice as “Paid.”
When she refreshes the Billing Summary Report, the “
Applied
” column now shows
$90.00
. This is because the payment received was applied to the invoice today.
The day at the clinic continues! Next, June Jackson walks into the clinic. She’d like to pay for the Yoga Mat she purchased yesterday at the Village location when she forgot her wallet.
The Yoga mat invoice was generated on June’s account yesterday. Deb collects payment for the yoga mat today for a total of
$52.50.
When she refreshes the Billing Summary Report, the Applied total now shows an increase for
$52.50
. The invoiced column will not change. As Deb marked the invoice as paid today, the payment will show up on today’s Summary Report (under “applied”), but yesterday under “invoiced” — since that is when the Yoga Mat invoice was generated.
For this reason, the “Invoiced” column and the “Applied” column, will not match up at day end!
We hope that this is helpful! Don’t hesitate to reach out to us at
support@janeapp.com
if you have any further questions about the Summary report. We’d be happy to guide you in the right direction :)

Billing Summary Report
9 min read
Balance Plan
Practice Plan
Thrive PlanWhat’s the Summary Report?
The Summary report provides a general overview of the day-to-day financial information of your clinic.
You can find this report by heading to
Reports > Summary
Using the Summary report, you’ll be able to contrast the amount that was
invoiced during the period
, and the
amounts applied to invoices
during the same time across various categories.  It can be useful for tracking who is paying you (we like these people!), and particularly helpful with tracking taxes invoiced and/or collected.  Users can run this report for any time period, and filter the results by any staff member.
💡 Speed up or slow down the video speed using the ⚙️ button inside the video player!
What’s included in the Summary Report?
There are up to 9 different sections that can be found in the Summary report:
Sales by Location
shows the amounts invoiced and payments applied by each location of your clinic.
Sales Breakdown
compares the amounts invoiced and payments applied for treatments and products.
Note:
The applied and invoice values of both the Sales by Location and Sales Breakdown will be the same, since they are both breakdowns of the same information (just displayed differently).
Income
lists all your income sources (patients and various insurers) and provides the total amounts invoiced and payments applied for each one.
Tax
shows the total amounts invoiced and payments applied for all kinds of tax.
For our Canadian clinics looking for more information on tax reporting, hop into the following guide:
Employee Contractor Taxes with Jane
Transactions
gives you the total applied for every different payment method.
Credit
lists any new credit created during the reporting period, and any past credit used during the reporting period.
Note: The “Credit” area of the Billing Summary report is interested in whether there was a
net change
in credit for a particular day. If a credit was created, then used on the same day, no overall net change was experienced, and it will not display on the report.
Refunds
shows the total amount in refunds processed during the reporting period.
Some sections and/or subsections that may show up depending on what was processed in the clinic include:
Gift Cards
which will summarize the dollar amount of gift cards being loaded & redeemed (used as payment for services or products).
New Payments with Balance Remaining (as of Today)
are new payments received that have balances remaining
as of today
(if there is no date range selected for your Summary report) and the balance remaining is an
account credit
.
New Credit Memos
are any new credit memo created during the reporting period.
Past Payments Applied
is related to the New Payments with Balance Remaining, except it’s referring to old payments received
prior to the time period you’re filtering
for
but
were applied during your filtered time period
.
Past Credit Memos Applied
are previously generated credit memos (outside of the filtered date range) that were
applied during your filtered date range
.
What are the Invoiced vs. Applied Amounts?
Let’s review how Jane is calculating the “
Invoiced
” totals and the “
Applied
” totals for this report, as they are actually displaying different bits of information. The
Invoiced total
shows total amount of invoices generated within the date range (some invoices may be unpaid). The
Applied total
shows total invoices
paid
within date range (this might include new payments being applied to old invoices).
A bit more on this:
you may generally settle up patient invoices after completing their session, making the date the invoices were generated and the date the payments are collected or “applied” occur on the same day. However, there are circumstances where the invoiced and applied totals may fall on different dates, for example— a client comes in for an appointment but does not settle up their invoice until a later date, or a patient pre-pays for an appointment that hasn’t happened yet. These are both examples of when the invoiced and applied payment totals do not fall on the same date, and will not match on the report.
Where can I explore the numbers in this report in more detail?
If you’d like to explore where the numbers in the Summary report are coming from, you’ll be able to take a look at all of the individual invoices that have been generated (the
Invoiced
totals) by working with the
Sales Report
, and for a list of the payments applied by practitioner, you can view the
Compensation report
. To see a list of all of the payments collected by the clinic, view the
Transaction Report
.
Summary, Sales, and Compensation Report Love Triangle
These reports represent Jane’s love triangle in the Reports section ❤️
The numbers in the Sales and Compensation reports make up what you see displayed in the Billing Summary report.
You’ll notice that the
Invoiced
Total on the Summary Report is going to match the Total Invoiced amount from the Sales report run in the same date range. There is no need to worry about making sure the two numbers match up, the Sales report is simply a way to view a detailed list of invoices run in the same date range.
The
Applied
Total on the Summary report plus Total Tips matches the Collected Total of the Compensation Report, since the Collected Total includes Tips in its calculation. Again, you do not need to worry about the below calculation, as Jane is doing the math for you.
Here’s an example, of the staff member Susan Lo’s Summary Report:
Applied total plus tips on the Summary Report: $28.50 + $4.28 = $32.78
Matches Collected total of Susan Lo’s Compensation Report:
Summary Report Example Scenario 📚
Deb at the Demo Clinic is starting a brand new day!
In the morning, Deb runs the
Billing Summary Report
and all totals are
$0.00.
The first patient of the day has arrived, and Deb at the front desk clicks the “Arrive” button to check them in. She has now created an invoice for a
$90.00
Massage visit.
When Deb refreshes the Billing Summary Report (by clicking Load a Fresh Copy), the Invoiced column now shows
$90.00
. Each time that an appointment in Jane is “Arrived,” or a product is invoiced to a patient account, it will appear under the “Invoiced” column, regardless of if the appointment or product has been paid.
We can also see the massage is categorized under “Treatment Income” in the Sales Breakdown:
And categorized as “Patient” income as the Income Source.
The massage visit is now complete and Deb collects payment by Visa for the massage appointment, marking the invoice as “Paid.”
When she refreshes the Billing Summary Report, the “
Applied
” column now shows
$90.00
. This is because the payment received was applied to the invoice today.
The day at the clinic continues! Next, June Jackson walks into the clinic. She’d like to pay for the Yoga Mat she purchased yesterday at the Village location when she forgot her wallet.
The Yoga mat invoice was generated on June’s account yesterday. Deb collects payment for the yoga mat today for a total of
$52.50.
When she refreshes the Billing Summary Report, the Applied total now shows an increase for
$52.50
. The invoiced column will not change. As Deb marked the invoice as paid today, the payment will show up on today’s Summary Report (under “applied”), but yesterday under “invoiced” — since that is when the Yoga Mat invoice was generated.
For this reason, the “Invoiced” column and the “Applied” column, will not match up at day end!
We hope that this is helpful! Don’t hesitate to reach out to us at
