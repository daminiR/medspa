We also talk a little bit about the future of this feature (and ask for your feedback!). If you don’t see what you’re looking for here, please don’t hesitate to\nget in touch with us\n.\nTroubleshooting:\nMy client received a notification but isn’t able to claim the appointment online\nMy client isn’t receiving notifications\nI’m getting a warning that my clinic settings don’t match my client’s notification preferences\nThe Wait List cue didn’t pop up when an appointment was cancelled\nWhy wasn’t a waitlist notification sent out for my class or group appointment?\nI’m not receiving any notifications about new or cancelled bookings.

Why isn’t Jane including that for clients who want longer appointments?\nCan I customize or edit the language in the SMS or Email notification that goes out?\nCan I enable Wait List Notifications for specific patients or types of appointments? (Ex. Not allow new patients to receive a Wait List Notification?)\nCan I still use this feature if I don’t use Online Booking?\nPlans for the future and your feedback 💙\nTroubleshooting\nPew pew pew! Let’s see if we can work through some common whoopsies:\n⭐ My client received a notification but isn’t able to claim the appointment online:\nThere may be a couple of reasons for this:\n#1: Someone else has already claimed the appointment:\nIf this is the case, when they click the link to View Available Openings from their email or SMS message, Jane will let them know that the spot is no longer available and give them the option to look or other appointment times:\n#2: Your Online Booking settings are preventing them from claiming the appointment online:\nIf your clients are getting a message asking them to\nContact to Book\n, this is likely due to your Online Booking settings. There are a few different places to check on this:\nSettings > Online Booking\n- you can double-check that Online Booking is enabled, that the Practitioner and specific Treatment are checked off, and check if same day bookings or bookings made within the ‘Do Not Allow within’ time are set as ‘Contact to Book’\nSchedule > Shift\n- you can check if the Shift itself is set as ‘Contact to Book’\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ My client isn’t receiving notifications:\nThis could be a couple of things: your client’s Wait List Notification preferences in their Client Profile or the ‘Do not allow within…’ window set in your Online Booking Settings.\nFor this one, we suggest starting your sleuthing in the\nClient/Patient tab\nand scrolling through their\nProfile\nuntil you find the Reminders/Notifications section. You can check to see which of the\nWait List Notification\noptions are checked off and edit them by clicking on the little pencil icon.\nIf you add a client to the Wait List, Jane will only select Email notifications by default. If your client adds themselves to the Wait List, they will\nselect their preferred notifications at that time\n. You can update their preferences for them in their Profile or they can\nupdate them from their My Account.\nIf none of your clients are receiving notifications (or a specific type of notification), you can head into your\nSettings >  Reminders & Notifications\nto check if you have Email and/or SMS Notifications enabled.\nIf that doesn’t solve the mystery, check your\nOnline Booking Settings!\nJane won’t automatically send notifications within your “Do not allow within…” window. The Wait List cue will still appear, though, and you can choose to click Send Notifications Now if you’d like.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ I’m getting a warning that my clinic settings don’t match my client’s notification preferences:\nIf you see this warning on the Wait List Notification panel, Jane is letting you know that your Jane account\nReminder & Notification Settings\naren’t matching up with how someone has requested to be notified.\nFor example, this could happen if you choose to disable SMS Notifications (Settings > Reminders & Notifications) and one of your clients had only selected SMS Notifications. If you do disable Email or SMS Notifications, Jane will hide this option from clients when they go to make new Wait List requests.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ The Wait List cue didn’t pop up when an appointment was cancelled\nThe most common reason for a Wait List cue (the black appointment block that pops up on the Schedule) not appearing is that the cancelled, deleted, no-showed, or moved appointment time falls within your clinic’s Online Booking “Do not allow booking within…” time\nand\nyou don’t have the ‘Show openings as contact to book’ box selected.\nIf you would like Wait List Notifications to be activated within this period, you can select ‘Show opening as contact to book’ and Jane will pop the Wait List cue onto the schedule for you. If you have automatic notifications turned on, Jane won’t send auto-notification within this timeframe, but you can manually click Send Notifications Now for eligible Wait List clients from the Wait List Notification panel if you’d like! Clients will be prompted to contact the clinic to book into this spot.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Why wasn’t a waitlist notification sent out for my class or group appointment?\nAt the moment, Jane will not send out notifications to patients on the waitlist for a group or class appointment. We’d love to hear your feedback on why this would be a helpful feature to have so make sure to upvote and add your thoughts to this\nFeature Request\n💙\n⭐ I’m not receiving any notifications about new or cancelled bookings. How can I fix that?\nThe ability to offer email notifications is an overall setting that impacts both staff and patient emails. To view and update this setting, head over to the\nSettings\ntab >\nReminders & Notifications\n. Once this setting is toggled on, you’ll have additional options to be notified for new, cancelled, or rescheduled appointments.\nFrom there, you’ll want to check the settings within your\nStaff Profile\n>\nEdit/Settings\n>\nSettings\n. Toggle on\nSend Email Notifications for New, Cancelled and Rescheduled Appointments\n. Jane will also provide you with options on whether you only want to be notified of appointment changes that have an impact on your schedule within a specific time frame.\nFor more details on these settings, check out this guide:\nEmail Notifications\n.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\nFAQ\nIs that a burning question we smell?\n⭐ Will Jane notify me when a client cancels through Online Booking?\nAs a practitioner, you can head into your Staff Profile Settings and enable Notifications for cancelled appointments.\nIf you are an Admin in Jane, we don’t have a way to notify you of all cancelled appointments for all practitioners, but with\nWait List Notifications\n, all cancelled appointments will be replaced with a\nWait List cue\n(a black appointment block that says ‘Wait List’). These make it easy to flip through your Schedule and see any recently cancelled appointments! If you’re not using automatic notifications, you can set your Exclusive Access period to a longer time frame to give yourself lots of time to see cancellations and fill them as you see fit.\nIf you would like an email notification for all cancelled appointments, what we often suggest is having your practitioners set up a filter for cancellation emails and forward them to your central admin email.\nTo do this in\nGmail\n: have your practitioners head into their Account Settings (using the\ngear icon\nin the top right corner) > See all Settings > Filters and Blocked Addresses > Create a New Filter. They can set the Subject as\nBooking Changes.\nWhen they click\nCreate filter,\nthey’ll see the option to\nAdd forwarding addresses\nand select\nForward it.\nNow, you’ll receive a notification of all cancelled appointments!\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I prioritize my Wait List Notifications?\nAt present, Jane doesn’t have a prioritization feature within the Wait List. This is something we’d love to build in the future, and\nwe would love your ideas and feedback to help us do that.\n💙\nIn the meantime, our suggestion for using Wait List Notifications with a bit more priority in mind would be to\nkeep automatic notifications turned off\n. This way, you still have the benefit of the Wait List cue on your Schedule, Jane will pull all the clients whose availability and preferences fit within a cancellation, and you can book a client straight in (or even send them notifications!) right from the Wait List Notification panel.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I customize Wait List Notification for each Staff Member?\nRight now, the Settings for Wait Lists are clinic-wide in Jane. Since Wait List Notifications will take Online Booking Settings into account, individual Staff may be able to ‘opt-out’ by adjusting their Staff, Treatment, or Shift Online Booking Settings to not allow Online Booking or to be ‘Contact to Book’, but they should be mindful of how this will affect their Online Booking as a whole.\nIf you’d like to see individualized Staff settings for Wait List Notifications, we’d love to hear more about what you’re looking for! Feel free to\nadd or vote on a Feature Request\n.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ How can I change my client’s Wait List Notification preferences (Email and/or SMS)?\nGreat question! You can adjust their preferences in their Client Profile. Scroll down to find where all their Reminder and Notification preferences are and you’ll see Wait List Notifications there as well. Just click the blue pencil icon to edit!\nClients can also do this themselves\nin their My Account.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ When I click Book Appointment, or when I send a notification for my client to Book Online, they’re being offered different times than the original appointment… why?\nThere could be a couple of reasons for this! Jane is really trying to help you fill up your Schedule, so clients will be offered any open spots on a Shift that could accommodate the client’s request.\nAnother reason might be that the cancelled, deleted, no-showed, or moved appointment was longer than the Wait List client’s requested appointment, so there are multiple options for start times within that appointment opening.\nFinally, Jane wants to respect each practitioner’s Staff Settings. If a practitioner is set up with Staggering or Sequential Online Booking preferences, Jane will take those into account when offering appointment times!\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ There’s a gap in my Schedule after a cancellation. Why isn’t Jane including that for clients who want longer appointments?\nAt present, Jane only takes the length of the cancelled, deleted, no-showed, or moved appointment into account when pulling clients from the Wait List. If this isn’t quite working for you, we’d love to hear about it! Feel free to\nadd or vote on a Feature Request\n, or\nreach out to us directly\n.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I customize or edit the language in the SMS or Email notification that goes out?\nNo, at the moment we don’t have a way for you to customize the message that your clients will receive either by email or text message. If this isn’t quite working for you, we’d love to hear about it! Feel free to add or vote on a\nFeature Request\n, or\nreach out to us\ndirectly.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I enable Wait List Notifications for specific patients or types of appointments? (Ex. Not allow new patients to receive a Wait List Notification?)\nNot right now, but if that’s something you’d like to see in the future,\nwe’d love to hear about it!\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I still use this feature if I don’t use Online Booking?\nYep! Your clients won’t be able to claim an appointment online or receive Automatic Notifications, but the Wait List cues will appear with all the fun options that come along with them.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\nPlans for the future and your feedback 💙\nWe’re so excited about this first step in making Wait List management in Jane so darn easy. We want to keep growing this feature to make it the most helpful it can be for you. If you find that this first version of Wait List Notifications doesn’t quite do everything you’d like it to, we’d love to hear about it!\nHere are a couple of Feature Requests we think many of you might have. We’d love it if you’d add your feedback there so we can use it as we think about how to continue building on this feature:\nClick here 👉\nI want to be able to organize the Wait List by priority.\nThings we’d love to hear:\nWhat do you base your prioritization on? (ex. last appointment date, length of relationship with a client, client requiring treatment sooner)\nHow do you envision setting this priority in Jane? (ex. assign a priority level within the Wait List, physically rearrange the Wait List, have Jane automatically sort clients based on certain factors, set priority within a client profile)\nClick here 👉\nI want Jane to automatically notify my Wait List clients of new openings based on their priority.\nThings we’d love to hear:\nHow long would you want Jane to wait before sending out a notification to the next person on the list?\nWould you want multiple ‘high’ or ‘medium’ priority clients notified at once? Or only one client notified at a time?\nClick here 👉\nI’d like to make a new Feature Request.\nIs there something else you think would make a helpful addition to this feature?

We also talk a little bit about the future of this feature (and ask for your feedback!). If you don’t see what you’re looking for here, please don’t hesitate to\nget in touch with us\n.\nTroubleshooting:\nMy client received a notification but isn’t able to claim the appointment online\nMy client isn’t receiving notifications\nI’m getting a warning that my clinic settings don’t match my client’s notification preferences\nThe Wait List cue didn’t pop up when an appointment was cancelled\nWhy wasn’t a waitlist notification sent out for my class or group appointment?\nI’m not receiving any notifications about new or cancelled bookings. How can I fix that?\nFAQ:\nWill Jane notify me when a client cancels through Online Booking?\nCan I prioritize my Wait List Notifications?\nCan I customize Wait List Notification for each Staff Member?\nHow can I change my client’s Wait List Notification preferences (Email and/or SMS)?\nWhen I click Book Appointment, or when I send a notification for my client to Book Online, they’re being offered different times than the original appointment… why?\nThere’s a gap in my Schedule after a cancellation. Why isn’t Jane including that for clients who want longer appointments?\nCan I customize or edit the language in the SMS or Email notification that goes out?\nCan I enable Wait List Notifications for specific patients or types of appointments? (Ex. Not allow new patients to receive a Wait List Notification?)\nCan I still use this feature if I don’t use Online Booking?\nPlans for the future and your feedback 💙\nTroubleshooting\nPew pew pew! Let’s see if we can work through some common whoopsies:\n⭐ My client received a notification but isn’t able to claim the appointment online:\nThere may be a couple of reasons for this:\n#1: Someone else has already claimed the appointment:\nIf this is the case, when they click the link to View Available Openings from their email or SMS message, Jane will let them know that the spot is no longer available and give them the option to look or other appointment times:\n#2: Your Online Booking settings are preventing them from claiming the appointment online:\nIf your clients are getting a message asking them to\nContact to Book\n, this is likely due to your Online Booking settings. There are a few different places to check on this:\nSettings > Online Booking\n- you can double-check that Online Booking is enabled, that the Practitioner and specific Treatment are checked off, and check if same day bookings or bookings made within the ‘Do Not Allow within’ time are set as ‘Contact to Book’\nSchedule > Shift\n- you can check if the Shift itself is set as ‘Contact to Book’\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ My client isn’t receiving notifications:\nThis could be a couple of things: your client’s Wait List Notification preferences in their Client Profile or the ‘Do not allow within…’ window set in your Online Booking Settings.\nFor this one, we suggest starting your sleuthing in the\nClient/Patient tab\nand scrolling through their\nProfile\nuntil you find the Reminders/Notifications section. You can check to see which of the\nWait List Notification\noptions are checked off and edit them by clicking on the little pencil icon.\nIf you add a client to the Wait List, Jane will only select Email notifications by default. If your client adds themselves to the Wait List, they will\nselect their preferred notifications at that time\n. You can update their preferences for them in their Profile or they can\nupdate them from their My Account.\nIf none of your clients are receiving notifications (or a specific type of notification), you can head into your\nSettings >  Reminders & Notifications\nto check if you have Email and/or SMS Notifications enabled.\nIf that doesn’t solve the mystery, check your\nOnline Booking Settings!\nJane won’t automatically send notifications within your “Do not allow within…” window. The Wait List cue will still appear, though, and you can choose to click Send Notifications Now if you’d like.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ I’m getting a warning that my clinic settings don’t match my client’s notification preferences:\nIf you see this warning on the Wait List Notification panel, Jane is letting you know that your Jane account\nReminder & Notification Settings\naren’t matching up with how someone has requested to be notified.\nFor example, this could happen if you choose to disable SMS Notifications (Settings > Reminders & Notifications) and one of your clients had only selected SMS Notifications. If you do disable Email or SMS Notifications, Jane will hide this option from clients when they go to make new Wait List requests.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ The Wait List cue didn’t pop up when an appointment was cancelled\nThe most common reason for a Wait List cue (the black appointment block that pops up on the Schedule) not appearing is that the cancelled, deleted, no-showed, or moved appointment time falls within your clinic’s Online Booking “Do not allow booking within…” time\nand\nyou don’t have the ‘Show openings as contact to book’ box selected.\nIf you would like Wait List Notifications to be activated within this period, you can select ‘Show opening as contact to book’ and Jane will pop the Wait List cue onto the schedule for you. If you have automatic notifications turned on, Jane won’t send auto-notification within this timeframe, but you can manually click Send Notifications Now for eligible Wait List clients from the Wait List Notification panel if you’d like! Clients will be prompted to contact the clinic to book into this spot.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Why wasn’t a waitlist notification sent out for my class or group appointment?\nAt the moment, Jane will not send out notifications to patients on the waitlist for a group or class appointment. We’d love to hear your feedback on why this would be a helpful feature to have so make sure to upvote and add your thoughts to this\nFeature Request\n💙\n⭐ I’m not receiving any notifications about new or cancelled bookings. How can I fix that?\nThe ability to offer email notifications is an overall setting that impacts both staff and patient emails. To view and update this setting, head over to the\nSettings\ntab >\nReminders & Notifications\n. Once this setting is toggled on, you’ll have additional options to be notified for new, cancelled, or rescheduled appointments.\nFrom there, you’ll want to check the settings within your\nStaff Profile\n>\nEdit/Settings\n>\nSettings\n. Toggle on\nSend Email Notifications for New, Cancelled and Rescheduled Appointments\n. Jane will also provide you with options on whether you only want to be notified of appointment changes that have an impact on your schedule within a specific time frame.\nFor more details on these settings, check out this guide:\nEmail Notifications\n.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\nFAQ\nIs that a burning question we smell?\n⭐ Will Jane notify me when a client cancels through Online Booking?\nAs a practitioner, you can head into your Staff Profile Settings and enable Notifications for cancelled appointments.\nIf you are an Admin in Jane, we don’t have a way to notify you of all cancelled appointments for all practitioners, but with\nWait List Notifications\n, all cancelled appointments will be replaced with a\nWait List cue\n(a black appointment block that says ‘Wait List’). These make it easy to flip through your Schedule and see any recently cancelled appointments! If you’re not using automatic notifications, you can set your Exclusive Access period to a longer time frame to give yourself lots of time to see cancellations and fill them as you see fit.\nIf you would like an email notification for all cancelled appointments, what we often suggest is having your practitioners set up a filter for cancellation emails and forward them to your central admin email.\nTo do this in\nGmail\n: have your practitioners head into their Account Settings (using the\ngear icon\nin the top right corner) > See all Settings > Filters and Blocked Addresses > Create a New Filter. They can set the Subject as\nBooking Changes.\nWhen they click\nCreate filter,\nthey’ll see the option to\nAdd forwarding addresses\nand select\nForward it.\nNow, you’ll receive a notification of all cancelled appointments!\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I prioritize my Wait List Notifications?\nAt present, Jane doesn’t have a prioritization feature within the Wait List. This is something we’d love to build in the future, and\nwe would love your ideas and feedback to help us do that.\n💙\nIn the meantime, our suggestion for using Wait List Notifications with a bit more priority in mind would be to\nkeep automatic notifications turned off\n. This way, you still have the benefit of the Wait List cue on your Schedule, Jane will pull all the clients whose availability and preferences fit within a cancellation, and you can book a client straight in (or even send them notifications!) right from the Wait List Notification panel.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I customize Wait List Notification for each Staff Member?\nRight now, the Settings for Wait Lists are clinic-wide in Jane. Since Wait List Notifications will take Online Booking Settings into account, individual Staff may be able to ‘opt-out’ by adjusting their Staff, Treatment, or Shift Online Booking Settings to not allow Online Booking or to be ‘Contact to Book’, but they should be mindful of how this will affect their Online Booking as a whole.\nIf you’d like to see individualized Staff settings for Wait List Notifications, we’d love to hear more about what you’re looking for! Feel free to\nadd or vote on a Feature Request\n.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ How can I change my client’s Wait List Notification preferences (Email and/or SMS)?\nGreat question! You can adjust their preferences in their Client Profile. Scroll down to find where all their Reminder and Notification preferences are and you’ll see Wait List Notifications there as well. Just click the blue pencil icon to edit!\nClients can also do this themselves\nin their My Account.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ When I click Book Appointment, or when I send a notification for my client to Book Online, they’re being offered different times than the original appointment… why?\nThere could be a couple of reasons for this! Jane is really trying to help you fill up your Schedule, so clients will be offered any open spots on a Shift that could accommodate the client’s request.\nAnother reason might be that the cancelled, deleted, no-showed, or moved appointment was longer than the Wait List client’s requested appointment, so there are multiple options for start times within that appointment opening.\nFinally, Jane wants to respect each practitioner’s Staff Settings. If a practitioner is set up with Staggering or Sequential Online Booking preferences, Jane will take those into account when offering appointment times!\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ There’s a gap in my Schedule after a cancellation. Why isn’t Jane including that for clients who want longer appointments?\nAt present, Jane only takes the length of the cancelled, deleted, no-showed, or moved appointment into account when pulling clients from the Wait List. If this isn’t quite working for you, we’d love to hear about it! Feel free to\nadd or vote on a Feature Request\n, or\nreach out to us directly\n.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I customize or edit the language in the SMS or Email notification that goes out?\nNo, at the moment we don’t have a way for you to customize the message that your clients will receive either by email or text message. If this isn’t quite working for you, we’d love to hear about it! Feel free to add or vote on a\nFeature Request\n, or\nreach out to us\ndirectly.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I enable Wait List Notifications for specific patients or types of appointments? (Ex. Not allow new patients to receive a Wait List Notification?)\nNot right now, but if that’s something you’d like to see in the future,\nwe’d love to hear about it!\n🔝\nSkip back to top\n⭐ Can I still use this feature if I don’t use Online Booking?\nYep! Your clients won’t be able to claim an appointment online or receive Automatic Notifications, but the Wait List cues will appear with all the fun options that come along with them.\n🔝\nSkip back to top\nPlans for the future and your feedback 💙\nWe’re so excited about this first step in making Wait List management in Jane so darn easy. We want to keep growing this feature to make it the most helpful it can be for you. If you find that this first version of Wait List Notifications doesn’t quite do everything you’d like it to, we’d love to hear about it!\nHere are a couple of Feature Requests we think many of you might have. We’d love it if you’d add your feedback there so we can use it as we think about how to continue building on this feature:\nClick here 👉\nI want to be able to organize the Wait List by priority.\nThings we’d love to hear:\nWhat do you base your prioritization on? (ex. last appointment date, length of relationship with a client, client requiring treatment sooner)\nHow do you envision setting this priority in Jane? (ex. assign a priority level within the Wait List, physically rearrange the Wait List, have Jane automatically sort clients based on certain factors, set priority within a client profile)\nClick here 👉\nI want Jane to automatically notify my Wait List clients of new openings based on their priority.\nThings we’d love to hear:\nHow long would you want Jane to wait before sending out a notification to the next person on the list?\nWould you want multiple ‘high’ or ‘medium’ priority clients notified at once? Or only one client notified at a time?\nClick here 👉\nI’d like to make a new Feature Request.\nIs there something else you think would make a helpful addition to this feature?
