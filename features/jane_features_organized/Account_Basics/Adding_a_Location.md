You might be a mobile practice and work in several different locations with different availability, or you might have multiple physical practices that share practitioners, client or patient base and branding.
Here’s where having another location set up will come in handy and this guide breaks that process down step-by-step.
Friendly reminder, there’s no charge for extra locations and you can add them anytime in your
Settings
tab.

Adding a New Location
For this first step, a
Full Access
staff member can head over to the
Settings
tab and then to
Locations
in the left sidebar menu. From there, click on the blue
+Create Location
button.
There are a couple of customizable options in this area that will affect how the location is displayed on the online booking site, on appointment reminders and even on financial documents like invoices and statements.
Note
📍:
For more information on where the Short and Long Description appear on your website, you can hover your mouse over the question mark to get a mini preview.
Contact Info:
Ever wondered what happens when a client responds to a
Thanks for Booking
notification or
Appointment Reminder
email? It gets sent to the email address listed here for the
Primary Location
. To view and update the primary location, head over to
Settings
>
Locations
and you’ll be able to view and reorder the locations in this area:
Here is the phone number that appears on your online booking site, appointment reminders and notifications as well as on financial documents like invoices, receipts and statements.
Location Address & Map:
You’ll have the option of selecting whether you’d like the location to be displayed on notifications and online booking as well as a map.
Billing Information:
This is the information that appears on all financial documentation that is sent out to your clients like invoices, receipts and patient statements.
If the address that you’d like to appear on the financial documents is different from the location entered in the previous section, you’ll want to
uncheck
use my location address for billing. This will open up a new set of fields that will allow you to enter an alternate address.
Note
📍:
If you are a virtual practice, then we have a great guide that walks through
How to Hide Your Location Address on the Online Booking Site
You can also add in your
Business Number
or
Tax Number
so they’re included on all financial documents issued from Jane.
Here’s a sneak peek at where it’s displayed:
Online Booking:
The home stretch! This last section will affect if the location will appear on the online booking site.
Since there are additional settings that contribute to whether a client or patient can see available times for a staff member, we recommend taking a look at our
Online Booking: Choosing what is Offered Online (Locations, Staff, Shifts, Treatments etc) and Individual Staff Preferences
guide for more detailed information 💙
Make sure that
Location is available to be booked online
is toggled on and hit that blue
Create Location
button to confirm those changes 🥳

Reordering Locations and Setting Your Primary Location
Have multiple clinic locations? No problem! You can easily change the order and even set a primary location.
To view and update the order of your locations or set a new primary location, a
Full Access
user will want to head over to the
Settings
tab and click on
Locations
within the left sidebar menu.
Next, click on the
Reorder Locations
button.
In the pop-up window, you can drag and drop the order you’d like the locations to appear in. This list is chronological so you’ll want to make sure the
Primary
location is the first one.
Add Your New Location to Treatments
You may want to offer some of the same treatments at your new location as well.
To ensure these treatments are available at your new location, you’ll need to pop over to the
Settings
tab and then click on
Treatments, Classes & Group Appointments
on the left sidebar menu. Next, click on the
Edit
button to the right of the treatment or on the blue text with the name of the treatment.
From there, scroll down to the
Details
section, and ensure that the new location is toggled on here:
Make sure to hit that blue
Update Treatment
button to confirm those changes 🤓
Note
📍: If this new location is offering a different set of treatments, you can create them and ensure that only the new location is selected. For a refresher, we’ll tuck in this guide on
Setting up Treatments
that walks through the steps.
Opt Staff into Location
Now that you have this new location set up, you will need to let Jane know who works there! Within every staff member’s profile, there is an area that lists all of your active locations. To view this setting, you’ll want to open up their profile and hit
Edit/Settings
.
Next, click on the
Settings
tab within the profile and toggle on the location(s) they work at.
Make sure to hit that blue
Save
button to confirm those changes.
Add shifts for Each Staff Member
Once you’ve told Jane who works at each location, you’ll have to also clarify
when
each person works. This step is especially important for clinics using online booking because if you don’t assign shifts, the staff members won’t show up on your online booking page.
To create shifts on the schedule, you’ll first want to make sure that each practitioner has their Staff Profile set up. See our guide doc on
Setting up Staff
for tips and more details on this process.
To start, you’ll want to head over to the
Schedule
tab and select the staff member you’d like to add shifts for on the staff menu to the left. Next, select the
Week
view at the bottom to change the view so you’re able to see the entire on a single screen.
From here, you’ll want to click on the word
Shifts
. The button should turn orange and that’s how you know you’re in Shift Editing mode.
Choose the day you want to create a shift. Don’t worry about being too precise with the time here! Jane will open up the
Edit Shift
panel to the right, where you can select and adjust the
Start At
and
End At
times for the shift.
You can also set the shift to Repeat for as long as you like. Remember to select an end date with the date picker to activate the repeat function. You can always delete or change a single shift later on without affecting the entire series.
If you want to have a set break, you can create multiple shifts in a day. You can also create multiple shifts to control which spots show as available for online booking.
For more information on this step, check out our guide docs on
Setting Up Shifts
and
Setting up Shifts FAQ
Add Your Payments Integration
If you have Jane’s Payment Integration, then you’ll need to opt this new location into your integration to receive payments online through Jane. Head over to the
Settings
tab, and then click
Jane Payments
on the left menu to view your Payment Account.
You’ll see a list of Jane Payments Accounts, and you can opt additional locations in by clicking the
blue pencil icon
next to the integration:
Additional Notes
Report Filters
You’ll now see a Location Filter on most of your reports (other than your Client List). Your Summary Report will also break down information location by location.
Keyboard Short Cuts
There’s a shortcut key to flip between locations - try using
Shift + L
on the main schedule to jump back and forth between locations quickly.
Pricing by Location
Another place you can further customize is on your treatments. Once you have more than one active location you can choose to offer different pricing by location if appropriate. Enable this feature in your
Settings
>
Billing Settings
area:
Once that’s enabled, your treatments will show multiple fields for pricing:!
Inventory by Location
You can also manage and track your inventory amounts by location. Once you have more than one active location, you will see multiple fields for inventory amounts on the product.
Jane will filter the inventory and re-order reports by location.
Location Dropdowns
Only one location schedule can be viewed at a time. To switch which location you are viewing, you can go to the top right of your screen where you will also see location dropdowns, or to the left of the schedule on the list of practitioners.
💡
Jane tip
: each location has a separate schedule page. If you work at multiple locations, it can be helpful to
manage shifts
for each location to help avoid double booking. You can view your schedule for your whole day, including appointments booked in multiple locations, with the
Print Day Sheet
feature by heading to your
Staff Profile > Print Day Sheet
. 
You can also subscribe your appointments for multiple locations to your calendars in Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook. To learn more about subscribing to your calendar, this guide can be helpful:
Subscribing to Your Calendar (for Staff)
.
Should I set up multiple locations or have multiple Jane Accounts?
We have a handy guide that breaks down the pros and cons of setting up a single account with multiple locations versus opening a separate Jane account for each location. You can check out that guide by
clicking here
.
Do I need another location if I’m moving from one location to another
Usually, another location is not needed.  On the date of the move, you will want to update your location address and information in the location currently in use.  You only need multiple locations if they are all being used at the same time. If you are moving your practice, learn more about how to update your settings and notify your clients by

Thrive PlanYou might be a mobile practice and work in several different locations with different availability, or you might have multiple physical practices that share practitioners, client or patient base and branding.
Here’s where having another location set up will come in handy and this guide breaks that process down step-by-step.
Friendly reminder, there’s no charge for extra locations and you can add them anytime in your
Settings
tab.

Adding a New Location
For this first step, a
Full Access
staff member can head over to the
Settings
tab and then to
Locations
in the left sidebar menu. From there, click on the blue
+Create Location
button.
There are a couple of customizable options in this area that will affect how the location is displayed on the online booking site, on appointment reminders and even on financial documents like invoices and statements.
Note
📍:
For more information on where the Short and Long Description appear on your website, you can hover your mouse over the question mark to get a mini preview.
Contact Info:
Ever wondered what happens when a client responds to a
Thanks for Booking
notification or
Appointment Reminder
email? It gets sent to the email address listed here for the
Primary Location
. To view and update the primary location, head over to
Settings
>
Locations
and you’ll be able to view and reorder the locations in this area:
Here is the phone number that appears on your online booking site, appointment reminders and notifications as well as on financial documents like invoices, receipts and statements.
Location Address & Map:
You’ll have the option of selecting whether you’d like the location to be displayed on notifications and online booking as well as a map.
Billing Information:
This is the information that appears on all financial documentation that is sent out to your clients like invoices, receipts and patient statements.
If the address that you’d like to appear on the financial documents is different from the location entered in the previous section, you’ll want to
uncheck
use my location address for billing. This will open up a new set of fields that will allow you to enter an alternate address.
Note
📍:
If you are a virtual practice, then we have a great guide that walks through
How to Hide Your Location Address on the Online Booking Site
You can also add in your
Business Number
or
Tax Number
so they’re included on all financial documents issued from Jane.
Here’s a sneak peek at where it’s displayed:
Online Booking:
The home stretch! This last section will affect if the location will appear on the online booking site.
Since there are additional settings that contribute to whether a client or patient can see available times for a staff member, we recommend taking a look at our
Online Booking: Choosing what is Offered Online (Locations, Staff, Shifts, Treatments etc) and Individual Staff Preferences
guide for more detailed information 💙
Make sure that
Location is available to be booked online
is toggled on and hit that blue
Create Location
button to confirm those changes 🥳
Additional Notes:

Why Isn’t my Availability Displaying Online? A Troubleshooting Guide
Reordering Locations and Setting Your Primary Location
Have multiple clinic locations? No problem! You can easily change the order and even set a primary location.
To view and update the order of your locations or set a new primary location, a
Full Access
user will want to head over to the
Settings
tab and click on
Locations
within the left sidebar menu.
Next, click on the
Reorder Locations
button.
In the pop-up window, you can drag and drop the order you’d like the locations to appear in. This list is chronological so you’ll want to make sure the
Primary
location is the first one.
Add Your New Location to Treatments
You may want to offer some of the same treatments at your new location as well.
To ensure these treatments are available at your new location, you’ll need to pop over to the
Settings
tab and then click on
Treatments, Classes & Group Appointments
on the left sidebar menu. Next, click on the
Edit
button to the right of the treatment or on the blue text with the name of the treatment.
From there, scroll down to the
Details
section, and ensure that the new location is toggled on here:
Make sure to hit that blue
Update Treatment
button to confirm those changes 🤓
Note
📍: If this new location is offering a different set of treatments, you can create them and ensure that only the new location is selected. For a refresher, we’ll tuck in this guide on
Setting up Treatments
that walks through the steps.
Opt Staff into Location
Now that you have this new location set up, you will need to let Jane know who works there! Within every staff member’s profile, there is an area that lists all of your active locations. To view this setting, you’ll want to open up their profile and hit
Edit/Settings
.
Next, click on the
Settings
tab within the profile and toggle on the location(s) they work at.
Make sure to hit that blue
Save
button to confirm those changes.
Add shifts for Each Staff Member
Once you’ve told Jane who works at each location, you’ll have to also clarify
when
each person works. This step is especially important for clinics using online booking because if you don’t assign shifts, the staff members won’t show up on your online booking page.
To create shifts on the schedule, you’ll first want to make sure that each practitioner has their Staff Profile set up. See our guide doc on
Setting up Staff
for tips and more details on this process.
To start, you’ll want to head over to the
Schedule
tab and select the staff member you’d like to add shifts for on the staff menu to the left. Next, select the
Week
view at the bottom to change the view so you’re able to see the entire on a single screen.
From here, you’ll want to click on the word
Shifts
. The button should turn orange and that’s how you know you’re in Shift Editing mode.
Choose the day you want to create a shift. Don’t worry about being too precise with the time here! Jane will open up the
Edit Shift
panel to the right, where you can select and adjust the
Start At
and
End At
times for the shift.
You can also set the shift to Repeat for as long as you like. Remember to select an end date with the date picker to activate the repeat function. You can always delete or change a single shift later on without affecting the entire series.
If you want to have a set break, you can create multiple shifts in a day. You can also create multiple shifts to control which spots show as available for online booking.
For more information on this step, check out our guide docs on
Setting Up Shifts
and
Setting up Shifts FAQ
Add Your Payments Integration
If you have Jane’s Payment Integration, then you’ll need to opt this new location into your integration to receive payments online through Jane. Head over to the
Settings
tab, and then click
Jane Payments
on the left menu to view your Payment Account.
You’ll see a list of Jane Payments Accounts, and you can opt additional locations in by clicking the
blue pencil icon
next to the integration:
Additional Notes
Report Filters
You’ll now see a Location Filter on most of your reports (other than your Client List). Your Summary Report will also break down information location by location.
Keyboard Short Cuts
There’s a shortcut key to flip between locations - try using
Shift + L
on the main schedule to jump back and forth between locations quickly.
Pricing by Location
Another place you can further customize is on your treatments. Once you have more than one active location you can choose to offer different pricing by location if appropriate. Enable this feature in your
Settings
>
Billing Settings
area:
Once that’s enabled, your treatments will show multiple fields for pricing:!
Inventory by Location
You can also manage and track your inventory amounts by location. Once you have more than one active location, you will see multiple fields for inventory amounts on the product.
Jane will filter the inventory and re-order reports by location.
Location Dropdowns
Only one location schedule can be viewed at a time. To switch which location you are viewing, you can go to the top right of your screen where you will also see location dropdowns, or to the left of the schedule on the list of practitioners.
💡
Jane tip
: each location has a separate schedule page. If you work at multiple locations, it can be helpful to
manage shifts
for each location to help avoid double booking. You can view your schedule for your whole day, including appointments booked in multiple locations, with the
Print Day Sheet
feature by heading to your
Staff Profile > Print Day Sheet
. 
You can also subscribe your appointments for multiple locations to your calendars in Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook. To learn more about subscribing to your calendar, this guide can be helpful:
Subscribing to Your Calendar (for Staff)
.
Should I set up multiple locations or have multiple Jane Accounts?
We have a handy guide that breaks down the pros and cons of setting up a single account with multiple locations versus opening a separate Jane account for each location. You can check out that guide by
clicking here
.
Do I need another location if I’m moving from one location to another
Usually, another location is not needed.  On the date of the move, you will want to update your location address and information in the location currently in use.  You only need multiple locations if they are all being used at the same time. If you are moving your practice, learn more about how to update your settings and notify your clients by
