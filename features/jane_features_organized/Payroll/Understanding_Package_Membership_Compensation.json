This guide will review how staff compensation works alongside Jane’s packages feature.\nFeel free to review our guides on\nWorking with Income Categories\nin case you need a quick refresher on how staff compensation works in Jane.\nA good question to ask yourself before we get started is:\n🌟 How do you plan to compensate your practitioner for a package or membership sale and redeemed sessions?\nCompensate Per Session:\nI would like to compensate my practitioner(s) when a patient redeems their package or membership for an appointment.\nCompensate for Package/Membership Upfront:\nI want to compensate my practitioner(s) upfront when the package or membership is initially purchased.\nAbout Package and Membership Compensation Settings\nConfiguring the Eligible Items section of your\npackage\nor\nmembership\ndetermines how staff are paid when a package is purchased or redeemed.\nPackages and Memberships are unique in that the amount that the patient pays per session may not necessarily equate to the compensation provided to the staff for that session.\nPackage Example\nA physiotherapy clinic charges their patients\n$60 for a standard follow-up visit\n. They also offer a package of 5 sessions if the patient pays $250 upfront— which comes to\na discounted $50 per session\n. After paying upfront, each time the patient attends their session, they are not required to pay any additional fee ($0 Additional Charge). The clinic owner may wish to value any subsequent visits covered by a package at its normal $60 rate. Alternatively, the clinic owner may wish to value these visits at their after-discount rate, $50.\nMembership Example\nA medical aesthetics clinic offers treatments such as Botox, dermal fillers and laser skin resurfacing. Many of these treatments require regular maintenance to achieve and sustain optimal results. The prices for subsequent treatments are standard, but they also offer a monthly membership of\n$99/month\n. Once the patient pays for the membership every month, each subsequent service they come in for does not require an additional fee. The clinic has a choice of setting the value of each service at their regular or the discounted value of service.\nFor both a package and a membership, the Staff Compensation field is setting the\n100% commission value\nof this particular treatment. Once this is set, a staff member will receive compensation based on the commission rate set for the\nincome category\nof the Eligible Item.\nThe default treatment price— which is set up under the\nSettings\ntab >\nTreatments, Classes & Group Appointments\narea — will be listed next to the treatment price for easy reference.  There are a few different ways this Staff Compensation value can be set:\nDefault Treatment Price\n: Set staff compensation to default treatment price\n(in the example above, this is the case for the Initial Assessment at $75)\nAfter Discount Value:\nSet staff compensation to discounted value per treatment\n(in the example above, this is the case for the Subsequent treatment, where the treatment price is usually $60, but staff compensation is set to $50)\nNo Compensation for Individual Sessions:\nSet compensation to $0\n(see example below)\nYou may wish to set the staff compensation per individual appointment to $0 if you intend to compensate your staff member for the entire upfront package or membership fee, rather than on a per-appointment basis.\nNow that we’ve got that covered, let’s take a look at a couple of different compensation styles.\nCompensate Per Session\n📍 Characteristics\n:\nNo staff member in particular is compensated for the upfront sale of the package or membership.\nA staff member is paid by the session, as the patient comes in.\nCan accommodate multiple staff members who provide eligible treatments covered by the package or membership.\nIf a patient does not fully use their package or membership, any unredeemed uses will go towards the general clinic funds.\nIf you are looking to compensate your practitioners when a patient redeems their package or membership for an appointment, you will want to set the\nStaff Compensation\nfield to a non-zero value. This may be the same value as the default treatment price, or a lesser value like the after-discount rate.\nIn the example below, we’ve set our package so that every time a patient redeems a package use for a 30 minute Subsequent Treatment, our staff’s compensation will be based off of a $50 rate. This also applies when you’re setting up the Eligible Items within a Membership.\nWhen\na package\nor a\nmembership\nis sold, no staff member will receive compensation for the initial sale. This is important so that we don’t accidentally compensate staff twice for the same package or membership.\nIf you are working with the\nInvoiced (Accrual)\nversion of the Compensation Report, a line item will appear once you arrive an appointment that is covered by a package or a membership. The\nadjusted\namount will reflect the value that was set in the Staff Compensation field back in the Package Settings.\nIf you are working with the\nCollected (Cash)\nversion of the Compensation Report, a line item will appear on the report as soon as the\nAdditional Charge\nportion has been paid. In many cases, the “Additional Charge” portion will be $0.00, so no further payment is required and the appointment will show up as a line item upon arrival as well. Here is an example of what this line item would look like.\nIf the staff member is on a certain commission schedule, this income will show up under the income category corresponding to that appointment type in the\nCommissions\nsection of the report.\nCompensate for Package or Membership Upfront\n📍 Characteristics\n:\nOne staff member is compensated for the entire sale of the package or membership when the initial payment is received.\nOnly a single staff member will be compensated, even if the package or membership includes treatments offered by multiple staff members.\nIt does not matter if a patient does not fully use their package, the staff member has already been paid in full upfront.\nIf you are looking to compensate your practitioners when a patient pays for their package or membership upfront, you will likely want to set the\nStaff Compensation\nfield of the package or membership to $0. This is to ensure that we don’t compensate a provider multiple times for the same sale.\nIn the example below, we’ve set our package so that every time a patient redeems a package use for a 30 minute Subsequent Treatment, our staff’s compensation will be based off of a $0 rate. The same can be done when setting up the compensation for a membership.\nWhen selling the package to your patient upfront, in this case, you will want to ensure that you\nassign a staff member\n. This means that the staff member will receive compensation for the sale of the package upfront. Rather, the sale of each session can be left unassigned – since the practitioner has already been compensated for the package.\nDuring the process of finalizing a membership, you won’t have the option to assign a staff member right away. You’ll need to head over to\nBilling\nwithin the patient’s profile, and under\nPurchases\nclick on\nView\nto the right of the membership invoice.\nNext, you’ll want to click on the\nAdd Staff Member\nbutton within the\nStaff Member receiving compensation\nsection.\nNote\n📝:\nFor memberships set to\nbill a patient automatically every billing cycle\n, Jane will not assign new membership invoices to the same staff member. If a specific staff member should be compensated upfront for each billing cycle, staff will want to make sure to assign the staff member manually using the steps mentioned above.\nIf you are working with the\nInvoiced (Accrual)\nversion of the Compensation Report, a line item will appear once you have invoiced and assigned a staff member to the package or membership sale.\nIf you are working with the\nCollected (Cash)\nversion of the Compensation Report, a line item will appear on the report as soon as the package or membership has been paid. Here is an example of what this line item would look like on the report:\nIf the staff member is on a certain commission schedule, this income will show up under the income category corresponding to that\npackage or membership type\nin the\nCommissions\nsection of the report.\nAnytime the package or membership is used in the future, since we had set the\nStaff Compensation\nrate to be based off of a $0 value, the staff member will receive no additional compensation for the individual appointments.\nIf you have any further questions about working with packages, memberships and compensating your staff members, don’t hesitate to\ncontact us\n!\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter.\nWelcome\nWelcome to the Jane Guide\nCode of Conduct\nFeature Requests\nJane's Brand Assets\nAccount Setup Consultations\nWhat's new in Jane?\nWhat's new in Jane Webinar\nJane's Changelog\nJane's Monthly Newsletter\nUpdates to Interchange Fees for Visa & Mastercard in Canada 🇨🇦\nHoward Spector joins Jane!\nJane Appoints Dan Davidow as Chief Marketing Officer\nJane App's Support Team Wins a Bronze Stevie® Award\nDemo Videos\nPractitioner's Home Base: Day Sheets & Charts\nJane in Action\nPractitioner Training:  Initial Signing In and Overview\nInsurance: Billing a Visit to a 3rd Party\nScheduling: Managing the Schedule with Many Practitioners\nDisciplines, Treatments, & Billing Settings\nSetting up Staff & Scheduling Shifts\nCharting: Signing, Duplicating & Symbols\nScheduling: Complete Schedule Overview\nBilling: Accepting Payments\nLaunching an Insurer Portal\nQuick Start\nStep 1: Clinic Information\nStep 2: Disciplines\nStep 3: Treatments\nStep 4: Staff\nStep 5: Schedule or Diary\nAdditional Set Up Recommendations\nPractitioner Step 1: Practitioner Training\nPractitioner Step 2: Treatments\nPractitioner Step 3: Shifts\nPractitioner Step 4: Online Booking\nPractitioner Step 5: Charting\nAccount Setup Consultations\nSwitching to Jane\nSwitching is easy with Jane on your team\nJane vs. SimplePractice\nAccount Basics\nHow To Check Who's Listed As Account Owner\nChecklist for Starting with Jane\nBrowser Requirements\nDevice & Network Recommendations\nUsing Jane on a Tablet\nUsing Jane on a Smartphone\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nAuto-Logout Duration\nUpdating Your Clinic Email Address & Phone Number\nLog In Help: Username and Password\nEnabling Patient Self Check-in\nAdding a Location\nBooking  a Break on a Mobile Device (Phone or other Small Screen)\nMoving Your Practice to a New Location\nMultiple Locations or Multiple Accounts: How to Set Up Jane for Independent Locations or Practitioners\nAccessibility in Jane\nI Can't Access My Jane Account: A Troubleshooting Guide\nHow to Archive a Treatment, Class or Group Appointment\nBookmarking Your Jane Account for Easy Access\nViewing Protected Financial Documents (For Patients)\nSwitching to the Balance Plan\nAdding a Billing Address for Locations\nUnauthorized Access: What to Do if Your Laptop/Phone is Lost or Stolen\nHow to Archive/Unarchive a Discipline\nHow to Change the Name of Your Clinic\nImporting to Jane\nHow to Import Data to Jane (Overview)\nBasics of Importing to Jane\nDiving Deeper Into Importing to Jane\nWhere Can You Import From?

This guide will review how staff compensation works alongside Jane’s packages feature.\nFeel free to review our guides on\nWorking with Income Categories\nin case you need a quick refresher on how staff compensation works in Jane.\nA good question to ask yourself before we get started is:\n🌟 How do you plan to compensate your practitioner for a package or membership sale and redeemed sessions?\nCompensate Per Session:\nI would like to compensate my practitioner(s) when a patient redeems their package or membership for an appointment.\nCompensate for Package/Membership Upfront:\nI want to compensate my practitioner(s) upfront when the package or membership is initially purchased.\nAbout Package and Membership Compensation Settings\nConfiguring the Eligible Items section of your\npackage\nor\nmembership\ndetermines how staff are paid when a package is purchased or redeemed.\nPackages and Memberships are unique in that the amount that the patient pays per session may not necessarily equate to the compensation provided to the staff for that session.\nPackage Example\nA physiotherapy clinic charges their patients\n$60 for a standard follow-up visit\n. They also offer a package of 5 sessions if the patient pays $250 upfront— which comes to\na discounted $50 per session\n. After paying upfront, each time the patient attends their session, they are not required to pay any additional fee ($0 Additional Charge). The clinic owner may wish to value any subsequent visits covered by a package at its normal $60 rate. Alternatively, the clinic owner may wish to value these visits at their after-discount rate, $50.\nMembership Example\nA medical aesthetics clinic offers treatments such as Botox, dermal fillers and laser skin resurfacing. Many of these treatments require regular maintenance to achieve and sustain optimal results. The prices for subsequent treatments are standard, but they also offer a monthly membership of\n$99/month\n. Once the patient pays for the membership every month, each subsequent service they come in for does not require an additional fee. The clinic has a choice of setting the value of each service at their regular or the discounted value of service.\nFor both a package and a membership, the Staff Compensation field is setting the\n100% commission value\nof this particular treatment. Once this is set, a staff member will receive compensation based on the commission rate set for the\nincome category\nof the Eligible Item.\nThe default treatment price— which is set up under the\nSettings\ntab >\nTreatments, Classes & Group Appointments\narea — will be listed next to the treatment price for easy reference.  There are a few different ways this Staff Compensation value can be set:\nDefault Treatment Price\n: Set staff compensation to default treatment price\n(in the example above, this is the case for the Initial Assessment at $75)\nAfter Discount Value:\nSet staff compensation to discounted value per treatment\n(in the example above, this is the case for the Subsequent treatment, where the treatment price is usually $60, but staff compensation is set to $50)\nNo Compensation for Individual Sessions:\nSet compensation to $0\n(see example below)\nYou may wish to set the staff compensation per individual appointment to $0 if you intend to compensate your staff member for the entire upfront package or membership fee, rather than on a per-appointment basis.\nNow that we’ve got that covered, let’s take a look at a couple of different compensation styles.\nCompensate Per Session\n📍 Characteristics\n:\nNo staff member in particular is compensated for the upfront sale of the package or membership.\nA staff member is paid by the session, as the patient comes in.\nCan accommodate multiple staff members who provide eligible treatments covered by the package or membership.\nIf a patient does not fully use their package or membership, any unredeemed uses will go towards the general clinic funds.\nIf you are looking to compensate your practitioners when a patient redeems their package or membership for an appointment, you will want to set the\nStaff Compensation\nfield to a non-zero value. This may be the same value as the default treatment price, or a lesser value like the after-discount rate.\nIn the example below, we’ve set our package so that every time a patient redeems a package use for a 30 minute Subsequent Treatment, our staff’s compensation will be based off of a $50 rate. This also applies when you’re setting up the Eligible Items within a Membership.\nWhen\na package\nor a\nmembership\nis sold, no staff member will receive compensation for the initial sale. This is important so that we don’t accidentally compensate staff twice for the same package or membership.\nIf you are working with the\nInvoiced (Accrual)\nversion of the Compensation Report, a line item will appear once you arrive an appointment that is covered by a package or a membership. The\nadjusted\namount will reflect the value that was set in the Staff Compensation field back in the Package Settings.\nIf you are working with the\nCollected (Cash)\nversion of the Compensation Report, a line item will appear on the report as soon as the\nAdditional Charge\nportion has been paid. In many cases, the “Additional Charge” portion will be $0.00, so no further payment is required and the appointment will show up as a line item upon arrival as well. Here is an example of what this line item would look like.\nIf the staff member is on a certain commission schedule, this income will show up under the income category corresponding to that appointment type in the\nCommissions\nsection of the report.\nCompensate for Package or Membership Upfront\n📍 Characteristics\n:\nOne staff member is compensated for the entire sale of the package or membership when the initial payment is received.\nOnly a single staff member will be compensated, even if the package or membership includes treatments offered by multiple staff members.\nIt does not matter if a patient does not fully use their package, the staff member has already been paid in full upfront.\nIf you are looking to compensate your practitioners when a patient pays for their package or membership upfront, you will likely want to set the\nStaff Compensation\nfield of the package or membership to $0. This is to ensure that we don’t compensate a provider multiple times for the same sale.\nIn the example below, we’ve set our package so that every time a patient redeems a package use for a 30 minute Subsequent Treatment, our staff’s compensation will be based off of a $0 rate. The same can be done when setting up the compensation for a membership.\nWhen selling the package to your patient upfront, in this case, you will want to ensure that you\nassign a staff member\n. This means that the staff member will receive compensation for the sale of the package upfront. Rather, the sale of each session can be left unassigned – since the practitioner has already been compensated for the package.\nDuring the process of finalizing a membership, you won’t have the option to assign a staff member right away. You’ll need to head over to\nBilling\nwithin the patient’s profile, and under\nPurchases\nclick on\nView\nto the right of the membership invoice.\nNext, you’ll want to click on the\nAdd Staff Member\nbutton within the\nStaff Member receiving compensation\nsection.\nNote\n📝:\nFor memberships set to\nbill a patient automatically every billing cycle\n, Jane will not assign new membership invoices to the same staff member. If a specific staff member should be compensated upfront for each billing cycle, staff will want to make sure to assign the staff member manually using the steps mentioned above.\nIf you are working with the\nInvoiced (Accrual)\nversion of the Compensation Report, a line item will appear once you have invoiced and assigned a staff member to the package or membership sale.\nIf you are working with the\nCollected (Cash)\nversion of the Compensation Report, a line item will appear on the report as soon as the package or membership has been paid. Here is an example of what this line item would look like on the report:\nIf the staff member is on a certain commission schedule, this income will show up under the income category corresponding to that\npackage or membership type\nin the\nCommissions\nsection of the report.\nAnytime the package or membership is used in the future, since we had set the\nStaff Compensation\nrate to be based off of a $0 value, the staff member will receive no additional compensation for the individual appointments.\nIf you have any further questions about working with packages, memberships and compensating your staff members, don’t hesitate to\ncontact us\n!Subscribe to our monthly newsletter.Jane Software Inc.\n500 - 138 13th Street East, North Vancouver\nBritish Columbia, Canada V7L 0E5\nContact Us\n+1 844-310-JANE (5263)\n+44 808 164 0893\n+61 1 800 940 893\n+1 604-670-JANE (5263)\nseejanerun@janeapp.com\nWant to keep up-to-date with everything that’s new in Jane?
