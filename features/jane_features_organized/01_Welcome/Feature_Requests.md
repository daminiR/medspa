Welcome
Feature Requests
9 min read
Have an idea for a new feature you’d like to see in Jane? We’d love to hear about it! We are constantly evaluating the challenging and complex decisions we have to make about what features move from our very,
very
long wish list, to being built by our development team.
So that we can better understand your priorities as a community, we have a dedicated
feature request platform
where you can submit, review, and vote on improvements for Jane. You’ll also receive updates as we begin to plan, build, and release new features as well.

The Roadmap
What is a Feature Request?
A feature request is a submission we receive from the Jane Community (you!)
describing a problem you are experiencing in your day-to-day workflow
, along with some
insight as to how we can make the experience better
. There are so many things we’d like to improve in Jane, so these requests are managed, reviewed, and prioritized via our online Feature Request Board (Canny).
This board is only accessible by users with an
active staff profile
associated with a Jane account.
Accessing the Feature Request Board
If you’d like to share your thoughts, head on over to the
Need Help?
button and navigate to the  Feature Requests section…
… or click on your name in the top corner, and look for Feature Requests in the drop-down.
Searching the Feature Request Board
At Jane, our mission is to Help the Helpers
(that’s you!)
Thankfully, our community is full of incredibly vocal members who love sharing their experience using Jane to run their practice. We really enjoy hearing from you because, well simply put, you provide such valuable feedback. Your voices = valuable feedback = happy people building Jane 💙
If you have a request for Jane, chances are, a fellow community member has already suggested it. Let’s work as a team 💪🏼 and let’s get all these voices under one roof searching the current feature requests before creating something new!
Here are a few
hot tips
🔥 when searching through the feature request page:
Search a Keyword
Any keywords that are used should match 👯‍♀️ the main theme of your request!
Search Using a Brief Sentence
Keep it simple! This will help narrow down your search and hopefully 🤞🏼 find what you are on the hunt for!
Browse a Category
We get it, sometimes you don’t know what you need or
want
until it’s staring 👀 right at you! If this sounds like you, feel free to browse a specific category and something may just jump out at you!
Creating
a New Request
To add a new request, start with a title in the Request form on the left.
Best Practices
Every clinic is different! We want to fully understand how this request will improve your day-to-day. Here are some best practices when creating a new feature request:
Describe
the problem you are having
Explain
how solving this problem would make a difference for your practice
Paint a picture
of how you manage this workflow currently
Here’s a great example!
This information is invaluable for our team to ensure we are building the right solution for your needs. It will also provide context to other members of the community who may share similar experiences (and their solutions!).
Voting for an Idea
Once logged into our feature request system, you’re ready to start exploring the features requested by our community. You can use the search bar in the top right to search for certain keywords, or you can sort and filter the list to see what is new, trending, or most voted.
💡 Having trouble finding a request? Try using synonyms for the particular feature (e.g.
calendar, schedule, day sheet
) to see if your request has been created and worded in another way.
To vote, click the up arrow on the idea you’d like to see rise to the top of the list.
Join the Discussion
This is by far our favourite part! We love to hear the ideas, and want you to expand on where these may go.
If you see an idea and want to contribute a little extra, we encourage you to click the title of the issue and tell us your story. Let us know more about the issue you are encountering and how this idea would help you.
Community Guidelines
Similar to our Facebook community group, there are a few guidelines we ask anyone posting to our Feature Request board to stick to and we do actively moderate the posts in our Feature Request Board. What does that mean? For most posts, nothing really. We’re just here to keep the space helpful, safe, inclusive, and constructive. We ask that everyone treat their fellow Jane community members with kindness and respect. Jane is committed to maintaining an inclusive and welcoming community so that everyone feels comfortable speaking up and sharing. Any posts that go against that will be moderated - this could be a request to edit the post, we may edit it ourselves for clarity, or we may remove the post altogether but we will always communicate with you before we make any changes.
To keep it simple, here are a few guidelines to consider when creating or commenting on a Feature Request!
1) Be Nice 😄
We have a zero-tolerance policy for negativity for negativity’s sake. If something is causing you frustration, remember to explain why in a constructive manner, and bonus posts if you also have a suggested solution! Like my blood type, let’s keep it positive!
2) Be Friendly 🤩
All Jane community members, whether customers, employees or partners, are expected to conduct themselves in a professional, courteous, and respectful manner when interacting with other members of the Jane community.
3) Be Helpful 🥰
Whether you are a Jane employee, customer or partner when you are active in the Jane Feature Request Board, each and every suggestion or request should be solution focused and aimed to improve your day-to-day tasks.
Members of the Feature Request board are all in different stages of their Jane journey from brand new members to some who have been with Jane since day one. If you see a request and have a solution or a workflow that works for you, feel free to hop in the thread and share!
Our Jane community is full of brilliant ideas 💡 and the best way to communicate those ideas is by following our Community Guidelines.
The
Roadmap
Planned
: Feature Requests added to the ‘Planned’ roadmap are items our team is still exploring, and determining all of the ways and the best ways to move forward (we’re perfectionists, what can we say) to execute a plan! While our team is still exploring and brainstorming these items, if those feature requests are
‘Planned’
we are
committed
to bring those ideas to life… however that incubation period is not quite determined.  Don’t worry, you will be updated when these ideas move along the pipeline!
In Progress:
The exploring, planning, and perfecting parts of the process are complete… our team of brilliant developers are hard at work making these features come to life! As soon as these Feature Requests are completed and ready to be launched, you will be notified. Just be sure you have voted/commented to receive these progress updates ;)
Complete
: Ta Da! The feature request is completed! Thank you for helping us make Jane better!
Click on the Roadmap to see what we’ve been planning, working on, and our most recently completed projects!
If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to drop us a line at

and we’d be happy to guide you in the right direction.

Welcome
Feature Requests
9 min readHave an idea for a new feature you’d like to see in Jane? We’d love to hear about it! We are constantly evaluating the challenging and complex decisions we have to make about what features move from our very,
very
long wish list, to being built by our development team.
So that we can better understand your priorities as a community, we have a dedicated
feature request platform
where you can submit, review, and vote on improvements for Jane. You’ll also receive updates as we begin to plan, build, and release new features as well.

The Roadmap
What is a Feature Request?
A feature request is a submission we receive from the Jane Community (you!)
describing a problem you are experiencing in your day-to-day workflow
, along with some
insight as to how we can make the experience better
. There are so many things we’d like to improve in Jane, so these requests are managed, reviewed, and prioritized via our online Feature Request Board (Canny).
This board is only accessible by users with an
active staff profile
associated with a Jane account.
Accessing the Feature Request Board
If you’d like to share your thoughts, head on over to the
Need Help?
button and navigate to the  Feature Requests section…
… or click on your name in the top corner, and look for Feature Requests in the drop-down.
Searching the Feature Request Board
At Jane, our mission is to Help the Helpers
(that’s you!)
Thankfully, our community is full of incredibly vocal members who love sharing their experience using Jane to run their practice. We really enjoy hearing from you because, well simply put, you provide such valuable feedback. Your voices = valuable feedback = happy people building Jane 💙
If you have a request for Jane, chances are, a fellow community member has already suggested it. Let’s work as a team 💪🏼 and let’s get all these voices under one roof searching the current feature requests before creating something new!
Here are a few
hot tips
🔥 when searching through the feature request page:
Search a Keyword
Any keywords that are used should match 👯‍♀️ the main theme of your request!
Search Using a Brief Sentence
Keep it simple! This will help narrow down your search and hopefully 🤞🏼 find what you are on the hunt for!
Browse a Category
We get it, sometimes you don’t know what you need or
want
until it’s staring 👀 right at you! If this sounds like you, feel free to browse a specific category and something may just jump out at you!
Creating
a New Request
To add a new request, start with a title in the Request form on the left.
Best Practices
Every clinic is different! We want to fully understand how this request will improve your day-to-day. Here are some best practices when creating a new feature request:
Describe
the problem you are having
Explain
how solving this problem would make a difference for your practice
Paint a picture
of how you manage this workflow currently
Here’s a great example!
This information is invaluable for our team to ensure we are building the right solution for your needs. It will also provide context to other members of the community who may share similar experiences (and their solutions!).
Voting for an Idea
Once logged into our feature request system, you’re ready to start exploring the features requested by our community. You can use the search bar in the top right to search for certain keywords, or you can sort and filter the list to see what is new, trending, or most voted.
💡 Having trouble finding a request? Try using synonyms for the particular feature (e.g.
calendar, schedule, day sheet
) to see if your request has been created and worded in another way.
To vote, click the up arrow on the idea you’d like to see rise to the top of the list.
Join the Discussion
This is by far our favourite part! We love to hear the ideas, and want you to expand on where these may go.
If you see an idea and want to contribute a little extra, we encourage you to click the title of the issue and tell us your story. Let us know more about the issue you are encountering and how this idea would help you.
Community Guidelines
Similar to our Facebook community group, there are a few guidelines we ask anyone posting to our Feature Request board to stick to and we do actively moderate the posts in our Feature Request Board. What does that mean? For most posts, nothing really. We’re just here to keep the space helpful, safe, inclusive, and constructive. We ask that everyone treat their fellow Jane community members with kindness and respect. Jane is committed to maintaining an inclusive and welcoming community so that everyone feels comfortable speaking up and sharing. Any posts that go against that will be moderated - this could be a request to edit the post, we may edit it ourselves for clarity, or we may remove the post altogether but we will always communicate with you before we make any changes.
To keep it simple, here are a few guidelines to consider when creating or commenting on a Feature Request!
1) Be Nice 😄
We have a zero-tolerance policy for negativity for negativity’s sake. If something is causing you frustration, remember to explain why in a constructive manner, and bonus posts if you also have a suggested solution! Like my blood type, let’s keep it positive!
2) Be Friendly 🤩
All Jane community members, whether customers, employees or partners, are expected to conduct themselves in a professional, courteous, and respectful manner when interacting with other members of the Jane community.
3) Be Helpful 🥰
Whether you are a Jane employee, customer or partner when you are active in the Jane Feature Request Board, each and every suggestion or request should be solution focused and aimed to improve your day-to-day tasks.
Members of the Feature Request board are all in different stages of their Jane journey from brand new members to some who have been with Jane since day one. If you see a request and have a solution or a workflow that works for you, feel free to hop in the thread and share!
Our Jane community is full of brilliant ideas 💡 and the best way to communicate those ideas is by following our Community Guidelines.
The
Roadmap
Planned
: Feature Requests added to the ‘Planned’ roadmap are items our team is still exploring, and determining all of the ways and the best ways to move forward (we’re perfectionists, what can we say) to execute a plan! While our team is still exploring and brainstorming these items, if those feature requests are
‘Planned’
we are
committed
to bring those ideas to life… however that incubation period is not quite determined.  Don’t worry, you will be updated when these ideas move along the pipeline!
In Progress:
The exploring, planning, and perfecting parts of the process are complete… our team of brilliant developers are hard at work making these features come to life! As soon as these Feature Requests are completed and ready to be launched, you will be notified. Just be sure you have voted/commented to receive these progress updates ;)
Complete
: Ta Da! The feature request is completed! Thank you for helping us make Jane better!
