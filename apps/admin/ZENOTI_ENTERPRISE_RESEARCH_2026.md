**Purpose:** Deep dive into Zenoti's enterprise-level messaging/automation capabilities and what large spa/salon/medspa chains need
**Sources:** Existing competitive analysis, Trustpilot reviews, LinkedIn, company materials

## Executive Summary

Zenoti is the dominant enterprise platform for multi-location spa/salon/medspa chains, with a focus on AI-powered automation and operational scale.

5. **Cost vs. value complaints** - "10x most booking systems" but "doesn't live up to sales pitch"
6. **Integration struggles** - API/third-party integration difficulties force dual systems
