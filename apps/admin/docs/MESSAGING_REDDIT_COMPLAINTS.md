## Executive Summary

While specific Reddit discussions from the targeted subreddits were limited, extensive user reviews from Capterra, G2, Trustpilot, and BBB revealed consistent pain points about messaging features in spa/salon/medspa software. The complaints span across major platforms including Boulevard, Vagaro, Mindbody, Mangomint, and others.

**Key Finding:** Users are frustrated not by lack of messaging features, but by poor implementation, lack of coordination between systems, and usability issues that create more work rather than saving time.

---

## 1. Texting Patients from Software

### Major Complaints

#### Boulevard
- **Non-functional texting:** "Boulevard was not user friendly, we encountered many issues and were given no resolution... We couldn't send texts to the clients, the function never worked correctly."
- **Support limitations:** "You can't call customer support, they only have the option to use a text box to contact customer service."
- **Android app issues:** "Complaints are even more pronounced on the Android side, where the majority of issues revolve around functionality-breaking bugs and a lack of support overall."

#### Vagaro
- **Notification reliability:** Users reported "nothing but issues for months with reminder confirmation messages or even saving appointments."
- **Delayed notifications:** "When booking appointments clients usually receive the booking notification immediately, it has taken up to 10 minutes for some clients."
- **Push notification deactivation:** One user reported going "through 100s of clients to make sure the push notification toggle was selected and over half had been untoggled."
- **Message sending failures:** Users encounter "issues with email automation, duplicate email problems, and excessive email notifications."

#### Mindbody
- **Non-functional features:** Reviews mention "a non-functional Messenger AI tool" among other problems.
- **Slow systems:** "The software is slow, buggy, and we had multiple problems with it."
- **Customer blame:** Support "blamed it on our Internet service" and later "blamed my computer" instead of taking accountability.

#### Goldie
- **Message failures:** "Message-sending failures" are a common complaint.
- **Cost concerns:** Users express concerns about "the cost of message automation."
- **Limited customization:** Users note "limited customization in the messaging system."

### Platform-Specific Limitations

- **SimpleTexting:** "Messages can get stuck in monitoring queues for 30+ minutes during high-volume periods."
- **10DLC Registration Issues:** "Since December 2024, complaints about 10DLC (10-Digit Long Code) registration have increased significantly" with "rejected campaign registrations without clear explanations."
- **Per-user fees:** "The per-user fee is particularly significant for businesses with multiple staff members who need to send texts. A five-person team adds $80/month to your bill."

---

## 2. Managing Conversations

### Conversation History Issues

#### Missing Features
- **No conversation search:** Klara users "have reported troubles with undelivered messages and difficulty searching in past conversations."
- **Automatic closure:** Mangomint "conversations that are inactive for 3 days will be closed automatically" which can lead to lost context.
- **Message deletion concerns:** In Mangomint, "deleting a sent text message will not undo sending the message" - only removes from view.

#### Multi-Platform Chaos
- **System fragmentation:** "Communicating with clients can get messy. When conversations happen across different devices and phone numbers, it can be difficult to keep track of every booking, reschedule request, and client question."
- **Multiple notification systems:** Healthcare providers "often have multiple notification systems — one for electronic medical records, another for prescription medications, and a different one from the marketing department — that do not coordinate with each other."

#### Boulevard-Specific Issues
- **Permanent notes:** "When you write a note about an appointment, it stays on that person's account forever, which can get confusing."
- **Can't delete records:** "Users have noticed you can't delete clients or products, which can be frustrating in certain scenarios."

---

## 3. Staff Permissions for Messaging

### Permission Control Gaps

#### Limited Granularity
While most platforms offer some permission controls, the complaints suggest they're not detailed enough:

- **GlossGenius:** Offers granular permissions including Marketing (mass campaigns), Business Settings, and Team Settings that can be toggled on/off.
- **Meevo:** Has 12 preconfigured security roles but lacks flexibility for custom workflows.
- **SalonAppy:** "Allows you to set different permissions for each employee you add" but customization is limited.

### Staff Communication Breakdown

#### Internal Team Chat Missing
- **Vagaro/Mangomint limitation:** "A major challenge with some spa software (Vagaro, Mangomint) is the lack of internal team communication - while they offer client communication features, there's no chat or announcements specifically for staff."
- **Mangomint specific:** "While it offers two-way client conversations, there's no internal team chat or messaging feature, meaning teams would still have to rely on external apps for all work-related communication."

#### Staff Training Issues
- **Mindbody:** "Makes serious changes without properly training their staff" and "they are making it hard for clients to sign up for your classes."
- **Complex interfaces:** Users report "slow response times and confusing interfaces" that lead to "glitches and limitations in both mobile and desktop versions, leading to frustration and extra work for staff."

---

## 4. Mobile App Messaging

### Critical Mobile App Issues

#### Boulevard
- **Bug-ridden apps:** "The Professional app is a must-have if you are a Boulevard customer, although major bugfixes are needed for both Android and iOS versions."
- **Platform disparity:** Android users face worse issues than iOS users with "functionality-breaking bugs and a lack of support overall."

#### General Mobile Problems
- **Speed issues:** Users complain about "programs speed, (line-ups at the frontdesk waiting for screens to load)."
- **Navigation slowness:** "Sometimes navigating on the website/app is slow and can't keep up with what I'm trying to do."
- **Multi-screen workarounds:** "The scheduling system isn't conducive to teams. I have to go between 'work hours' for each person and the appointment schedule. I have to use my iPhone to look at one view and the laptop for another."

#### Rosy Salon Software
- **Cross-platform promise:** "Was the first cloud-based software designed specifically for the salon industry and allows you to view and manage the entire application on your smartphone, tablet, Mac, or PC" - but implementation quality varies.

---

## 5. Notification Overload

### The Notification Bombardment Problem

#### Healthcare-Specific Overload
- **Multiple systems:** "Health care providers often have multiple notification systems — one for electronic medical records, another for prescription medications, and a different one from the marketing department — that do not coordinate with each other. This can lead to notification overload for patients."
- **Provider acknowledgment:** Emily Kagan Trenchard, Northwell Health's chief of consumer digital solutions: "We've recognized that our patients are feeling bombarded... Endless notifications are 'not the way to keep them engaged.'"
- **Industry expert quote:** Oliver Kharraz, CEO of ZocDoc: "All of these systems were built for the provider and were never patient-focused."

#### Real-World Examples
- **Northwell Health case:** "Previously, Northwell had five different systems that notified patients via text, email and automated phone calls."
- **Client perspective:** One review noted that clients "don't want or need to hear from you all the time. Be thoughtful, be judicious, and give them a chance to respond before you hit them up again."

### Best Practices Ignored

Users complain that software doesn't enforce or make it easy to follow these guidelines:
- **Frequency management:** "Timing is key when it comes to SMS marketing; you don't want to send messages too frequently or too infrequently."
- **Character limits:** "Short, punchy text messages work best... Stay within the 160-character limit" but systems don't enforce this.
- **Unsubscribe options:** "It's important to allow patients to unsubscribe to text message notifications" - must be easy and visible.

---

## 6. HIPAA Concerns with Texting

### Compliance Anxiety

#### The Core Problem
- **Default non-compliance:** "Standard text messaging from phone to phone is not HIPAA-compliant by default, which is why healthcare organizations need a HIPAA-compliant texting platform."
- **Dangerous convenience:** "Med spas should avoid using unsecured methods like personal emails or text messages to communicate patient information. Instead, they should use encrypted emails or secure messaging platforms that are HIPAA-compliant."

#### What Can/Can't Be Texted

**ALLOWED in appointment reminders:**
- Patients' first and last names
- Date and time of appointment
- Provider's first and last name
- Provider's phone number

**PROHIBITED:**
- Test results
- The nature of your patient's disease/condition
- Any treatment plans and/or diagnoses

### Security Requirements

#### Must-Have Features
- **End-to-end encryption:** "HIPAA-compliant platforms encrypt data in transit and at rest, making intercepted messages unreadable."
- **Audit logs:** Standard messaging platforms "do not provide encryption, audit logs, or BAA capabilities. Using them to share Protected Health Information (PHI) can result in noncompliance and significant legal penalties."
- **Business Associate Agreements (BAA):** Required by law but many platforms don't offer them or charge extra.

### Compliance Costs

#### Expensive Add-Ons
- **SlickText:** Paid plans begin as low as $0.058 per message credit.
- **Hiver:** HIPAA compliance is available "exclusively on the Elite plan ($75/user/month) and for enterprise customers."
- **Hidden costs:** "Many features cost extra: Forms, EMR tools, and two-way texting require add-ons, so the price can rise quickly."

#### Platform-Specific HIPAA Issues

**TigerConnect:**
- **Complexity:** "The platform's advanced feature set can be overwhelming for basic communication needs."
- **Pricing opacity:** "Tiger doesn't publish pricing info, so you'll need to book an appointment with their sales team."
- **Technical glitches:** "Some users have reported occasional technical glitches and role-based permissions challenges."

**OhMD:**
- **Mixed reviews:** "Users on G2 praise its ease of use... However, others have reported technical issues and very manual processes."

**AestheticsPro:**
- **Weak integrations:** "The API is limited, so clinics that use advanced marketing tools or external CRMs may find syncing data challenging."

**Mangomint:**
- **Limited clinical depth:** "Lacks robust medical charting and advanced EMR features needed by injector-heavy clinics."
- **Rising costs:** "Total costs can rise quickly with add-ons and per-location fees."
- **HIPAA weaknesses:** "Not as strong for HIPAA workflows or medical documentation compared to purpose-built aesthetic EMRs."

## 7. Additional Pain Points

### Customer Service Nightmares

#### Mindbody
- **Nearly unreachable:** "Our fees are now over $1,000 CAD/month—nearly double the competition. To make it worse, customer service is nearly impossible to reach. When you finally get through, instead of speaking to a real human you get AI responses or links to 'how to fix it yourself' articles."
- **Rating disaster:** "MINDBODY has a rating of 1.2 stars from 79 reviews on Sitejabber."
- **Auto-renewal trap:** "Mindbody will auto-renew contracts every 12 months without consent, and the cancellation process is described as a nightmare."

#### Vagaro
- **Argumentative support:** "Customer service is unhelpful at best and argumentative at worst."
- **Long wait times:** "Customer service takes an hour to get through to a person, and they are not helpful."
- **Disappearing support:** One complaint describes a support person who "disappeared for 5+ days, coming back citing sick leave, without having passed my case onto an on-duty colleague."

### Inventory & Billing Integration Issues

#### Vagaro
- **Inventory chaos:** "Horrible customer service... software messed up my inventory constantly. Every time I went in to do inventory it was wrong!"
- **Revenue loss:** "We lost so much revenue from glitches, clients ability to delete their payment method from their profile, preventing us from being able to charge a cancellation fee."

### Marketing Message Cost Traps

#### Vagaro
- **Billing for bounces:** Users complain "it would be nice if VAGARO were not billing us on the Bounce emails."

#### General Issue
- **Credit calculation opacity:** "Longer messages consume multiple credits, and the calculation isn't always transparent."

### Missing Basic Features

#### Mangomint
- **No self-rescheduling:** "We were shocked to find after the onboarding process that clients do not have the option to reschedule their own appointments. With any other service on the market, this is a basic feature."
- **No tip prompts:** "When clients pay using memberships or packages, there is no automated prompt for the client to have the option to tip the service provider."

#### Fresha
- **Missing integrations:** "Some users on Capterra have noted the absence of certain business integrations, such as chat messaging, payroll, group booking, patient portal, and accounting functionalities."

## 8. What Users Actually Want

### Positive Examples from Reviews

#### Mangomint (when it works)
- "Best customer experience I have ever had and I've tried onboarding with Salonbiz, Zenoti, Vagaro, and Mindbody."
- "The client chats that the whole staff can see" - visibility appreciated.
- "Very customizable menus" - flexibility valued.
- Described as "intuitive and beautiful to use" with "standout support."
- "Feels light but powerful" with "seamless automations."

#### Boulevard (for luxury spas)
- Users praise the "luxury client experience" and "reliable onboarding support."
- Described as "Apple-level spa software" though "cost feels steep for solo practices."

#### What Makes Messaging Work
- **Text message effectiveness:** "98% open rate and 45% response rate" when done right.
- **Reference value:** "A text conversation can be easily referenced... allows clients to reference critical dates and other information."
- **Centralized history:** "View a client's complete communication history, including automated reminders and marketing messages, all in one conversation stream."
- **No-show reduction:** "Automated text messaging is considered a business booster that reduces no-shows through appointment reminders sent 24-48 hours in advance."
- **Speed:** "The majority of text messages are opened within three minutes of being sent."

## 9. Industry Context & Statistics

### Market Challenges

**Staff Management Crisis:**
- **Top problem:** "48% of US salon owners have identified appointment management as their biggest business challenge, and it's worse for solo professionals."
- **Integration hell:** "One of the biggest frustrations that salon business owners run into is that the digital tools they're using don't integrate or 'talk' to each other."

### HIPAA Adoption Growing
- "In 2024–2025, healthcare organizations have rapidly increased their adoption of HIPAA compliant messaging apps."
- "Over 68% of hospitals now use secure messaging platforms for staff communication, up from 52% in 2022."

### Legal Requirements
- **TCPA compliance:** "By federal law, businesses can only send marketing texts to clients who have explicitly opted in to receive them, and they must provide a clear way to opt out at any time."
- **Permission required:** "TCPA requires that you first gain permission from patients to send those reminders."
