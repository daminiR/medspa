## Decision Needed:

**Should we:**
A) Complete remaining billing features (Phase 4 & 5)?
   - Pros: Fully complete billing module
   - Cons: Reports are less exciting to build
   - Timeline: 1-2 weeks

B) Start charting features (more interesting)?
   - Pros: Core clinical features, more impactful
   - Cons: Billing not 100% complete
   - Timeline: Start fresh module

C) Mix approach?
   - Morning: Quick billing fixes (photos, inventory)
   - Afternoon: Start charting (SOAP notes)
   - Timeline: Parallel progress

---

## Recommendation:

**Go with Option C - Mixed Approach**
1. Quickly add photos & inventory (half day)
2. Build basic daily report (half day)
3. Then move to charting (exciting new features)
4. Return to advanced billing reports later

This keeps momentum while not leaving critical gaps!
