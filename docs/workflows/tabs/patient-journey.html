                            <p class="problem">Problem: System sends reminders at T-48hrs, T-24hrs, T-2hrs. All marked "Delivered" but patient never got them. Carrier spam filter blocked medical spa texts. Patient shows up confused: "I never got any reminders!"</p>
                            <p class="solution">Track SMS delivery status: "Sent" vs "Delivered" vs "Read". If pattern of un-delivered messages to same carrier (e.g., T-Mobile), alert IT. Use shortcode or verified sender ID to avoid spam filters. Fallback to email if SMS consistently fails. Backup: Front desk calls unconfirmed appointments 24hrs before.</p>
                            <p class="human-needed">IT works with Twilio to resolve deliverability issues. Front desk manually calls patients who haven't confirmed to verify they're coming. Consider switching SMS providers if delivery rate <95%.</p>

                            <p class="problem">Problem: Patient's appointment is Friday 2:00 PM. They show up Thursday 2:00 PM. Or show up at 2:00 PM when appointment is 4:00 PM.</p>
                            <p class="solution">When patient checks in (any method), system confirms: "Checking you in for your 2:00 PM appointment on Friday, September 15. Correct? [YES] [NO]". If patient clicks NO or arrives on wrong day, system detects mismatch and alerts front desk: "Sarah checked in but appointment is tomorrow!" Auto-message: "We see your appointment is scheduled for tomorrow. Would you like to reschedule for today if available?"</p>
                            <p class="human-needed">Front desk checks practitioner availability. If slot available today, offer to switch. If no availability, apologize and confirm tomorrow's appointment. Update patient with correct date/time via SMS immediately.</p>

A manager will call you within 30 minutes to resolve this." Remove from all automated message sequences immediately.

                            <p class="human-needed">Manager calls patient within 30 mins to apologize and resolve issue. Often scenarios: (1) Appointment was cancelled in system but SMS already queued, (2) Patient confused with different practice, (3) Legitimate complaint about over-messaging.
