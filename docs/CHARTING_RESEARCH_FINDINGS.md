# Charting System Research Findings
## Compiled: December 2024

Based on research from Reddit, professional forums, and industry EMR analysis.

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding:** Practitioners want BOTH zones AND precise points - not one or the other.

| Use Case | Preferred Method |
|----------|-----------------|
| Safety/Training | Zone-based (understand danger areas) |
| Filler documentation | Areas/zones (larger coverage) |
| Neurotoxin documentation | Precise points (specific muscle targets) |
| Personal technique library | Custom points they create themselves |

---

## Top Pain Points (What Practitioners Hate)

### 1. Fragmented Systems
- Juggling separate tools for charting, photos, inventory, scheduling
- Manual/inconsistent charting leads to missed details, errors, audit risk

### 2. Rigid Templates
- EMRs lack flexibility, force rigid input formats
- Can't customize to match their workflow
- Generic EMRs lack aesthetic-specific features

### 3. No Photo Annotation
- Can't draw directly on patient photos
- Limited before-and-after comparison tools
- Photo management is afterthought, not core feature

### 4. Slow Charting
- Takes too long - want 40-50% time reduction
- Healthcare professionals spend 4+ hours daily on EMR tasks
- Need quick-keys, dot phrases, auto-fill

### 5. Poor Mobile Apps
- Desktop features missing on mobile
- Forced to use app for some features, web for others
- Frequent updates interrupt sessions

### 6. Inventory Disconnected
- Manually tracking lot numbers and units used
- No auto-deduction when documenting treatments
- Separate systems for charting vs inventory

### 7. Terrible Support
- AestheticsPro: "HORRIBLE support & customer service"
- Boulevard: Limited mobile functionality
- Many systems: Outdated interfaces, glitches, data issues

## Most Requested Features

### Must-Have (High Priority)

1. **Draw on Photos**
   - Plot injection points directly on patient images
   - Photo markup and editing tools
   - Direct marking during or after treatment

2. **Custom Templates**
   - Start from templates but heavily customize
   - Pre-built for procedures (dermal fillers, chemical peels, microneedling)
   - Reduce charting time by 50%

3. **Quick Keys / Dot Phrases**
   - Type `.BOT` → auto-fill Botox template
   - Save 20-30 minutes per note
   - AI-assisted charting with auto-populate

4. **Photo Alignment/Ghosting**
   - Overlay before photos for consistent positioning
   - Ensure identical patient positioning
   - Side-by-side comparisons

5. **Inventory Sync**
   - Auto-deduct units when documented
   - Track lot numbers, expiration dates
   - Prevent administration of expired products

6. **Mobile Charting**
   - Full functionality, not limited app
   - Remote monitoring of schedules
   - Access from treatment rooms

### Differentiating Features

1. **Personal Injection Point Library**
   - Save "my sweet spots" with notes
   - Name them personally
   - Track usage over time
   - Competitive advantage for experienced injectors

2. **Asymmetry Documentation**
   - Note pre-existing asymmetries
   - Critical for liability protection
   - Document deviations and reasoning

3. **Technique Notation**
   - Record cannula vs needle
   - Injection direction
   - Depth (intradermal, mid-dermal, deep-dermal)
   - Linear threading, cross-hatching, microdroplet, bolus

4. **Color-Coded Products**
   - Different colors for different injectables
   - Visual differentiation on charts
   - Example: Botox in blue, Restylane in yellow

5. **AI Documentation**
   - Voice-to-chart
   - Auto-generate SOAP notes
   - Ambient recording transcription (70% time reduction)

## Zone vs Point Preference

### Zone-Based Approach (Training/Safety)
- Research establishes high-risk injection zones
- 12-zone mapping for forehead documented in studies
- Safety-focused with anatomical landmarks
- Focus on "3D, dynamic" facial anatomy
- Essential for training new injectors

### Precise Point Documentation (Experienced Injectors)
- Plot exact injection points on patient photos
- Add specific unit amounts at each location
- Visual record of needle insertion locations
- Compare subtle changes between sessions

### Best Practice: Hybrid Approach
1. Use zone understanding for planning (safety/training)
2. Document precise points for each session
3. Combines safety knowledge with patient-specific precision
4. Compare with previous charts for consistency

---

## Templates vs Custom Documentation

### Why Standardized Templates Matter
- Legal protection from compliance specialists
- Regulatory compliance with best practices
- Time savings vs building from scratch
- Consistency - no critical elements missed

### Why Customization is Essential
- State law variations (regulations differ by state)
- Practice differentiation (unique techniques)
- Workflow alignment (each practice is different)
- Branding (documentation reflects practice identity)
- Product mix (different product lines)

### Recommended Approach
- Standardized templates as foundation
- Significant customization options
- Ability to modify without vendor support
- Version control for protocol updates

---

## How Experienced Injectors Document

### Documentation Practices
1. **Custom Face Maps** - Personal treatment maps with recommended units
2. **Asymmetry Assessment** - Document pre-existing asymmetries for liability
3. **Dosing Patterns** - Document deviations from standard guidelines
4. **Anatomical Variations** - Note individual patient anatomy
5. **Technique Notation** - Which technique used and why
6. **Depth Documentation** - Track injection depth per point
7. **Cannula vs Needle** - Document tool choice and reasoning

### Initial Consultation Workflow (45+ min)
1. Photograph from multiple standardized angles
2. Assess and document facial anatomy and asymmetries
3. Discuss goals and document patient preferences
4. Create customized treatment maps
5. Discuss risks specific to planned approach
