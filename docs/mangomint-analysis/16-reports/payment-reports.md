This article covers the Payment reports available in the Reports app. Payment reports can help you track payment details, cash drawer activity, deposits, and more.

In the Payment Summary and Payment Details reports, payments, reversal payments, and credit card refunds are included based on the date they occurred.

In most cases, payments occur on the sale date, but the payment may occur on a different date if:

A deposit was collected before the appointment and the sale was closed on a later date

The sale was reopened on a different date and another payment was added

The sale date is changed after the payment is completed
