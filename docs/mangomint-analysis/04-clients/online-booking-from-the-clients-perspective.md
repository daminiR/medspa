Online Booking from the Client’s Perspective

With online booking, clients can book appointments online through your website or any other platform where your booking link is shared.

Clients do not need to log in or create an account to use online booking. This ensures an easy and convenient booking experience for your clients.

To learn more about online booking for your clients, watch our on-demand Online Booking For Your Clients video.

Online booking from the client’s perspective

The video below shows an example of a client booking an appointment through online booking. In this example, the online booking link was added to the business’s website.

In the video, the client:

Has the option to buy a gift card online

Customizes the selected service using service customizations

Has the option to add multiple services to their appointment

Has the option to join the waitlist if they don’t find a time that works for them

Agrees to your cancellation policy. Clients are required to agree to your cancellation policy to book an appointment through online booking.

Has the option to upload up to 3 reference or inspiration photos after successfully booking their appointment

Has the ability to complete the required form after successfully booking their appointment. Clients can also complete their forms in person.

In this example, the client was not required to enter their credit card information to book the service. However, you can require clients to enter their credit card information to book specific services. Having a card on file for a client is helpful if you need to enforce your cancellation policy and charge the client any no-show or cancellation fees.

After a successful booking, the client will receive an automated message with their appointment details. You can also set up internal notifications and flows for online bookings.

Learn more about setting up online booking and adjusting online booking preferences. You can also use direct booking links for individual staff members, services, and service categories.
