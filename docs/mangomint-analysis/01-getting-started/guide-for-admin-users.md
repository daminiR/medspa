Playground mode

When you first sign up, your Mangomint account will be in playground mode. Playground mode adds sample data to your account so you can try out Mangomint’s features in a test environment. A Demo label is added next to any sample data.

You can disable playground mode by selecting I'm ready! on your Get Started page.

Data import

If you are transferring to Mangomint from a previous scheduling software, our team is happy to import your data.

For most systems, we can import the following:

Clients (including contact details): It will take about 24 hours to import your clients once we receive all your client information.

Products, inventory, and gift cards: We will import your products, inventory, and gift cards a few days before your launch date to ensure you have more accurate stock levels and gift card balances.

Depending on your previous scheduling software, we may or may not be able to import client notes, formulas, previous sales, and previous appointments. Your Onboarding Manager will discuss this with you during your onboarding session.

Launch date

Your launch date is the date you will start to use Mangomint as your day-to-day scheduling software and turn off your previous scheduling software. Picking a launch date will help you determine which future appointments from your previous scheduling software you will need to transfer into Mangomint. You only need to transfer future appointments from your launch date onward.

Transfer future appointments

If you are transferring to Mangomint from a previous scheduling software, you will need to manually transfer future appointments (from your launch date onward) into Mangomint.

Before transferring future appointments, disable your automated messages in Mangomint so that your clients don’t receive notifications as you work through the transfer process.

If you are importing your client list into Mangomint, please wait until we have finished importing clients before transferring appointments.

During the transfer process, keep the appointments up to date in both your previous software and Mangomint. Any change to a future appointment (such as rescheduling or cancellation) should be made in both systems.
