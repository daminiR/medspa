ABOUT MANGOMINT
Using Mangomint with a Booth Renter or Hybrid Model

Mangomint can support businesses that have a booth rental or hybrid model.

Booth renters are service providers who are usually charged a flat or variable fee to rent space (booth, chair, room, etc.) within a salon, spa, or studio instead of getting paid an hourly rate or commission by the business.

A hybrid model refers to a business that has booth renters and other types of workers, including service providers who are paid hourly or commission.

Businesses that have a booth renter or hybrid model can use one Mangomint account to easily manage all their workers.

To learn more about managing booth renter and hybrid models, watch our on-demand Booth Renter & Hybrid Models video.

Mangomint features for booth renter & hybrid models

Mangomint includes the following features that can be used with booth renter and hybrid models:

Payment (merchant) accounts: Booth renters can have their own payment (merchant) account, allowing them to receive payments directly to their own bank account.

Taking payments at the booth or on the go: Booth renters can process payments at their booth or on the go by connecting their own card reader to their iPhone or iPad.

Direct booking links: Clients can book directly with a booth renter by using the booth renter’s direct booking link.

Client ownership: Booth renters can be assigned as the owner of a client. This ensures they will only have access to their own clients.

Product ownership: Booth renters can be assigned as the owner of a product. This ensures they will receive the funds when a product they own is sold.

Collecting rent payments from booth renters: You can collect rent payments from booth renters automatically using a membership.

Payment (merchant) accounts

Payment accounts allow booth renters to receive payments directly to their own bank account.

To set up a payment account for a booth renter, an Admin will first need to create the payment account. Then, the booth renter can complete the process by signing up for the payment account.

Booth renters can access their assigned payment account to see how much they made. They will be paid according to the payout schedule. Booth renters are only responsible for per-transaction fees, which will be deducted from their payouts.

By default, all gift card, package, and membership sales go into the primary payment account for the business, even if the booth renter has their own payment account. Any gift cards, packages, or memberships that are redeemed will need to be paid out to the booth renter separately.

Product ownership

Product ownership settings allow booth renters to receive the funds when a product they own is sold.

By default, all product sales go into the primary payment account for the business. However, if a product has an owner, the product sale will be routed to the product owner’s payment account.

Any product commission will need to be paid out to the booth renter separately.

Collecting rent payments from booth renters

You can collect rent payments from booth renters using a membership. This can be helpful if you want to automatically collect rent payments from booth renters when rent is due. This method works best when booth renters are charged the same amount of rent each billing period.

To charge and collect rent via Mangomint using a membership, you will need to:

Create a booth rent service and set the service price to the rent amount.

Create a booth rent membership plan. Set the billing frequency to match how often you charge rent, disable the Charge service tax toggle, and add the booth rent service to the membership plan.

Create a client profile for each booth renter.

Start a new booth rent membership for each booth renter. You can specify whether to collect membership payments automatically or manually for each booth renter.

Membership payments are considered deferred revenue. They will appear in the Membership Payments report, but they will not appear in the Sales Summary report unless the membership services are redeemed.

For membership payments collected via Mangomint’s payment processing, you will be paid out for the membership payments according to your regular payout schedule.
