Learn more about the Payroll report and how you can process payroll directly in Mangomint.

The Payroll report includes all closed sales with a sale date in the selected time period. The sale date may be different than the date the sale was closed if you:

Manually change the sale date after the sale is closed

Require a full payment in online booking and close the sale on a later date. The sale date is the date the sale was closed, not the date the full payment was collected in online booking.
