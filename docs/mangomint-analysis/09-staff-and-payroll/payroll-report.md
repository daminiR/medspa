Pay adjustments

Pay adjustments allow you to easily and quickly adjust a staff member’s total compensation without having to update any specific sales.

Pay adjustments can be helpful if you’d like to give a staff member a bonus. You can also add a negative pay adjustment to deduct a specific amount from a staff member’s pay.

Adding a pay adjustment

To add a pay adjustment, you must be an Admin user, or you must have the Can manage payroll adjustments permission enabled in Staff Member settings.

Select the "+" button in the Pay Adjustments column and select a date for the pay adjustment. Enter the pay adjustment details and select Add.

Once the pay adjustment is added, the staff member’s total compensation is updated in the report. The table below outlines which columns in the report are affected by the different pay adjustment types.
