Flows Basics

Flows can help you accomplish different tasks, including:

Send rebooking reminders to clients

Send pre and post-care instructions to clients based on booked services

Send internal messages to staff members when specific events occur, such as a form submission or a large transaction

Flows are highly flexible and can be customized to your unique business needs. In the following example, when a client has completed 2 facial appointments, they will receive a text promoting a facial membership.

The basic building blocks of a flow include:

Trigger: Triggers are the events in Mangomint that cause a flow to start.

Conditions: Conditions allow you to filter based on specific client criteria such as client tags and previous appointments.

Actions: Actions include sending emails and text messages, waiting a certain amount of time before completing the next step in the flow, or adding to the client's account balance.

The table below provides a few examples of how you can use flows in Mangomint.

How these apps can work together

	

Example flow




Flows + Sales

	

Send rebooking reminders to clients and cross-sell services.

	

When a client completes a Botox treatment, send the client a rebooking reminder in two months. After one week, if the client still hasn’t rebooked, send the client a text to cross-sell services such as dermal fillers.




Flows + Sales

	

Send review requests to frequent clients.

	

When a client completes at least 3 appointments, send the client a text with a link to leave a review (e.g. Google reviews).




Flows + Calendar

	

Send pre and post-appointment instructions to clients based on appointment service.

	

Two days before a client’s waxing or sugaring appointment, send the client pre-care instructions to help them prepare for their appointment.

When a client completes a spray tan appointment, send the client post-care instructions.




Flows + Calendar

	

Re-engage clients if their appointment is canceled.

	

When a client's appointment is canceled, send the client a text reminding them to rebook their canceled appointment.




Flows + Offers

	

Reward clients by giving them a discount or a free service/product.

	

When a client completes 5 appointments, send the client a text with a promo code for a discounted or free service.




Flows + Forms

	

Send messages based on form responses.

	

When a client selects a high rating on a feedback form, send the client a rebooking reminder. When a client selects a low rating, send a notification to an internal email address.




Flows + Memberships

	

Send clients direct purchase links for specific membership plans.

	

When a client completes 2 massage appointments, send the client a text with a link to purchase a massage membership online.




Flows + Packages

	

Send clients direct purchase links for specific packages.

	

When a client completes a haircut & color appointment, send the client an email with a link to purchase a haircut & color package online.




Flows + Products

	

Follow-up with clients who purchased specific products.

	

When a client purchases a specific product, send the client a text the next day to remind them how to use that product. After three weeks, send the client a product refill reminder.




Flows + Gift Cards

	

Promote a gift card to a client based on the client’s sales history.

	

When a client completes a facial appointment, wait one week, then send the client a text with a link to your gift card promotion where they can purchase a $100 gift card for $75 to use on any facial services.

The Flows app can also be used in addition to the Campaigns app and your automated messages from the Settings app.
