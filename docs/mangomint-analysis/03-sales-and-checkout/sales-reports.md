This article covers the Sales reports available in the Reports app.

Sales reports can help you track service sales, product sales, service customizations, and more.

Sales reports include all closed sales with a sale date in the selected time period. The sale date may be different than the date the sale was closed if you:

Manually change the sale date after the sale is closed

Require a full payment in online booking and close the sale on a later date. The sale date is the date the sale was closed, not the date the full payment was collected in online booking.
