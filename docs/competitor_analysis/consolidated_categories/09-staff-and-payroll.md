Clock In and Out on a Front Desk Device

You can enable the Time Clock app on a front desk device so staff members can clock in and out. This is helpful if you would like staff members to clock in and out in person.

To set up the front desk device, open the Staff Members app.

Create a new staff member called Front Desk and enable the Can view Time Clock app permission.

Log in as the Front Desk staff member on the front desk device. Staff members can now enter their time clock PIN on the front desk device to clock in and out.

You can disable the Can view Time Clock app permission for individual staff members so they do not have access to the Time Clock app on their personal devices.

STAFF MEMBER WORK HOURS & DAYS OFF
Set Days Off for Multiple Staff Members at Once

You can set specific staff members to “not working” for a single day or custom date range. This can be helpful when the business is closed for the holidays, staff members take vacation, or any other time when you need to schedule multiple days off at once.

When staff member schedules are set to off, no appointments will be available in online booking for those dates. Online booking will remain enabled so clients can book future dates when the business is open or when staff members are working.

To get started, open the Settings app and select Calendar & Appointments > Quick Tools.

Select Use the set staff to “Not Working” tool.

Select the location(s), staff members, and date range.

If you select an entire month, such as March 2025, the entire month of March will be set to "not working" for those staff members.

To select a specific day or date range, select Custom Time Period and specify the day or date range. For example, to set March 6 as "not working", set March 6 as both the Start date and End date.

Select Submit. Once submitted, normal staff schedules are overridden and will resume at the end of the date range.

Tips Settings for Payroll Processing

If a staff member is enrolled in Payroll Processing, you can choose not to pay out the staff member’s tips via Payroll Processing. This is helpful if you pay out your staff members' tips separately from payroll.

To do this, open the Staff Members app and select the staff member. Select the Compensation tab and go to Payroll Settings.

Link copied
Tips settings for Payroll Processing (U.S.)

For U.S. customers, enable the Consider all tips as already paid toggle. When enabled, the staff member's tips will not be paid via Payroll Processing.

Link copied
Tips settings for Payroll Processing (Canada)

For Canadian customers, use the Consider all tips as direct tips toggle to determine whether a staff member's tips will be paid via Payroll Processing.

When this toggle is enabled, the staff member's tips will be considered direct tips. Direct tips are paid directly to staff members and are not included in payroll payments or paystubs.

When this toggle is disabled, the staff member's tips will be considered controlled tips. Controlled tips are taxable income and will be included in payroll payments and paystubs.

### 11. Completing The Employer Onboarding For Payroll

**Source**: [https://www.mangomint.com/learn/completing-the-employer-onboarding-for-payroll/](https://www.mangomint.com/learn/completing-the-employer-onboarding-for-payroll/)

HOME
PAYROLL PROCESSING
EMPLOYER ONBOARDING FOR PAYROLL
Completing the Employer Onboarding for Payroll
IN THIS ARTICLE
Let’s get started
Add your work location
Set up a pay group
Get your team ready
Fill in your tax info
Add company bank account
Sign company documents
Verify default company bank account

This article provides guidelines for completing each section of the employer onboarding for Payroll Processing.

Admin users will receive daily email reminders if there are any onboarding tasks that must be completed to begin processing payroll.

Link copied
Let’s get started

In the Let’s get started section, enter the requested information to personalize your onboarding experience.

Your first payday is the first date you’d like to begin paying your workers through Mangomint. Keep in mind this date is not final—this date is simply for the Mangomint team so we can help you stay on track and complete your onboarding in time for your first payday.

Let us know if you’ve paid any workers this year. If you have, we will contact you to help you migrate your previous payroll history. This step is important to ensure all your payroll taxes are properly transferred.

Link copied
Add your work location

In the Add your work location section, enter all the addresses where you have staff members physically working.

If you change your address in Apps > Settings > Business Setup > Locations after onboarding, make sure you also update the address in this section (it will not be updated automatically).

Your default work location, principal address, and filing address do not all need to be the same address.

The table below outlines the different address types:

Address type

	

Description




Default work location

	

The default work location for any new workers you add. If you have multiple work locations, you do not need to specify a default work location. You will be able to choose each worker’s default work location manually.




Principal address

	

The address included on your workers’ paystubs, such as your main office or headquarters. This address does not need to match the address you have on file with the IRS.




Filing address

	

The address you have on file with the IRS. This address is also known as the legal address, and it is used when sending payroll filings to tax agencies. You will specify this address in the Fill in your tax info section.

For example, if all of your workers work at 1600 Grand St., that will be both the Default work location and Principal address.

If you use a different address for your company’s taxes (157 Brookside Ave.), that will be the Filing address.

Link copied
Set up a pay group

In the Set up a pay group section, specify how often you’d like to pay your workers.

A pay group is a group of workers. Each pay group has an assigned pay frequency.

You can name your pay groups however you’d like. For example, you can name your pay group Bi-weekly if the workers in that pay group are paid every other week.

You can create multiple pay groups if you pay different groups of workers at different times. For example, you can assign your 1099 contractors to a weekly pay group and your W-2 employees to a bi-weekly pay group. There is no additional cost to create or use multiple pay groups.

If you specify a default pay group, any new workers you add will be added to that pay group automatically.

Link copied
Determining your pay dates and pay periods

The images below show an example of pay dates and pay periods.

In this example, the worker is paid every other week.

The worker will be paid on June 14 (pay date) for work performed May 26–June 8 (pay period). For direct deposit, your pay period must end at least 4 days before your pay date.

Following this example, the image below shows the worker’s next pay date and pay period for June.

Link copied
Get your team ready

In the Get your team ready section, set up your workers for payroll. If you need help determining a worker’s classification, please consult an accountant.

Once you begin this section, you will be able to see if there are any workers in this step who require more information to be ready for payday.

Link copied
Inviting workers

If you invite workers to enter their own payroll details, they will receive an email with a link where they can enter their information including their direct deposit details. Workers must complete their email invitation to be paid through Payroll Processing.

If you need to resend an email invitation to a worker, go to Apps > Staff Members and select the staff member.

Select the Compensation tab and select Resend invite.

Link copied
Overtime eligibility

In the Additional setup info step, select Finish setup for each worker and specify whether the worker is eligible for overtime pay. You will not be able to pay workers until their overtime eligibility is specified.

Link copied
Fill in your tax info

In the Fill in your tax info section, enter your federal and state tax information. If you need help completing this section, please consult an accountant.

An FEIN and EIN are the same number (Employer Identification Number).

In the Federal tax info step, specify your Federal deposit schedule that was given to you by the IRS when you received your EIN. You can leave the Effective date as is.

It’s important that you select your correct schedule to avoid any penalties. If you don’t know your federal deposit schedule, you can select Semi-weekly. However, consider contacting the IRS to confirm your correct federal deposit schedule.

In the State tax info step, specify the state tax information (e.g. account number, IDs, rates, deposit schedules) for each work location you entered (each state where your workers live and work). You do not need to complete this step if you only have 1099 contractors.

Link copied
Add company bank account

In the Add company bank account section, specify the default company bank account to use for taxes and direct deposit payments.

You can either:

Add and verify the bank account instantly using Plaid.

Add the bank account manually and verify it using two small deposits. The two small deposits should appear in the account in 1-2 business days.

In this section, you will sign a Debit Authorization form to allow us to debit the account for taxes and direct deposit payments.

Link copied
Sign company documents

In the Sign company documents section, provide your signature to allow us to pay and file your payroll taxes.

In this section, you will sign any required documents based on the information you provided in the previous sections. Example forms include the Reporting Agent Authorization form and Power of Attorney form.

Link copied
Verify default company bank account

In this section, enter the amount of the two small deposits sent to the account. Enter each amount separately using the two Amount fields. This section is only required if you need to manually verify your default company bank account (if you didn’t use Plaid).

Archiving a Staff Member

This article covers how to archive and unarchive a staff member. Once a staff member is archived, they will no longer have access to Mangomint.

Archived staff members will not appear in the Payroll report, Staff reports, or Business Intelligence reports, even if they performed services during the selected time period. We recommend exporting these reports before archiving a staff member. Alternatively, you can unarchive a staff member to run reports and then archive the staff member again.

Sales for archived staff members will continue to appear in Sales and Payment reports.

Link copied
Archiving a staff member

Before archiving a staff member who is paid via Payroll Processing, you will need to remove the staff member from your payroll.

To archive a staff member, open the Staff Members app and select the staff member to archive.

Select Archive from the "..." menu.

Link copied
Unarchiving a staff member

To unarchive a staff member, open the Staff Members app and select Show Archived Staff at the bottom of the staff member list.

Select the staff member to unarchive and select Re-Activate.

After setting up the time clock, staff members can clock in and out and use task types.

If a staff member has the Can view Time Clock app permission enabled, they can clock in and out from any device where they are logged in. If a staff member does not have this permission enabled, they can still clock in using their PIN in another account where the Time Clock app is visible, such as a front desk device.

Clocking in and out

To clock in, open the Time Clock app.

Enter your PIN that was assigned to you by your Admin and select Next. Select Clock In.

To clock out, repeat these same steps and select Clock Out.

Link copied
Using task types

After setting up task types, you can use them in the Time Clock app.

To use a task type, make sure you are currently clocked in. Once you are clocked in, open the Time Clock app. Enter your PIN and select Next.

To begin a task type, select it from the available task types. To complete the task type, enter your PIN and select Next. Select End.

Adding and Removing Staff Members from Your Payroll

After signing up for Payroll Processing, you can add and remove staff members from your payroll as needed.

Link copied
Adding a staff member to your payroll

To add a staff member to your payroll, the billing user for your account will need to add a worker to your Payroll Processing add-on via the Subscription page. If you are an Admin user, you can also contact chat support to request to add a worker to your payroll subscription.

Once the worker is added to your payroll subscription, open the Staff Members app and select the staff member. Select the Compensation tab.

Select Sign Up to send the staff member an email with a link where they can enter their payroll details, including their direct deposit information.

Once you select Sign Up, the staff member’s Payroll Processing status will be updated to Invited. A list of the staff member's required payroll details will be displayed until the staff member completes their onboarding.

If you prefer to enroll the staff member in Payroll Processing yourself instead of having the staff member complete the email invitation, you can select Complete payroll setup. This allows you to enter the staff member’s payroll details on their behalf.

Once the staff member’s Payroll Processing status is Active, they will be automatically included in your default pay group.

If you do not have a default pay group, you must manually add the staff member to a pay group to pay the staff member via Payroll Processing.

To view or edit your pay groups, open the Settings app and select Business Setup > Payroll.

If you have one payroll account, select Account settings. If you have multiple payroll accounts, select Manage account > Account settings.

Select Edit next to Pay groups.

Link copied
Removing a staff member from your payroll
Important: 

Once you terminate a worker who is connected to payroll, you must notify chat support so they can disconnect the worker and remove them from your payroll billing cost.

Before removing a staff member from your payroll, make sure you’ve paid the staff member for their final days of work. Once you remove a staff member from your payroll, you cannot process payroll for them.

To remove a staff member from your payroll, reach out to chat support and provide the following information:

Worker's name

Reason for termination (voluntary, involuntary, etc.)

Last date of employment

Open the Settings app and select Business Setup > Payroll.

If you have one payroll account, select Account settings. If you have multiple payroll accounts, select Manage account > Account settings.

Select Edit next to Pay groups.

Disable the staff member's toggle in their pay group and select Save.

Setting Up a Payment Account for a Staff Member

If you are an Admin user, you can create additional payment accounts for staff members. This is helpful for businesses that do not handle payments for independent contractors or booth renters.

With this setup, staff members can have their own payment accounts and payment processors. Any checkout with the assigned staff member will automatically direct payment to that staff member's payment account.

Link copied
Creating a payment account for a staff member

To create a payment account for a staff member, open the Settings app and select Payments & Checkout > Payment Accounts.

Select Create new payment account.

Select the staff member(s) who will use this payment account. Select Continue.

Enter a name for the payment account. If only one staff member is selected, the system will automatically use the staff member's name.

Select Create to create the payment account.

Once the payment account is created, the staff member will need to sign up for the payment account.

### 25. Payroll Accounts

**Source**: [https://www.mangomint.com/learn/payroll-accounts/](https://www.mangomint.com/learn/payroll-accounts/)

#### Content

HOME
BUSINESS SETUP
PAYROLL ACCOUNTS
Adding Payroll Accounts

If you have multiple legal entities (e.g. EINs) and you would like to use Payroll Processing, you will need to create a different payroll account for each entity.

For example, if you have 3 different legal entities, you will need to create 3 payroll accounts.

When creating a payroll account, you must assign locations to the payroll account. You can assign multiple locations to the same payroll account if you have multiple locations under the same legal entity.

Link copied
Adding payroll accounts

The number of payroll accounts you can add is the same as the number of physical and virtual locations you have. For example, if you have five locations, you can have a maximum of five payroll accounts.

After signing up for Payroll Processing for your first legal entity, you can add another payroll account by opening the Settings app and selecting Business Setup > Payroll > Add payroll account.

Select the location(s) that will use this payroll account and select Continue to create the account.

If you need to change the assigned locations for a payroll account, select Assign locations from the "..." menu.

To rename a payroll account, select Rename from the "..." menu. This is helpful if you’d like to give each payroll account a custom name.

Once you’ve added multiple payroll accounts and assigned the correct locations to each account, each payroll account must be signed up for Payroll Processing.

Select Manage account > Sign up now for each payroll account to begin the signup process.

Note: 

Payroll Processing costs $50/month + $8/month per worker. If you use multiple payroll accounts, each payroll account signed up for Payroll Processing costs $50/month + $8/month per worker.

Once each payroll account is signed up for Payroll Processing and completed onboarding, open the Staff Members app and select the Compensation tab. Make sure the correct compensation is set up for any staff members who work at multiple locations assigned to different payroll accounts.

You can also select the Services tab in the Staff Members app to set commission overrides for specific payroll accounts if needed.

After setting up staff member compensation, you can run payroll for each payroll account.

If a staff member works at multiple locations assigned to different payroll accounts, you will need to run payroll for each payroll account to pay the staff member everything they earned across those locations.

Running payroll in Mangomint

To run payroll in Mangomint, you must be an Admin user, or you must have the Can process payroll runs permission enabled in Staff Member settings.

Important: 

Before you run payroll, generate the Payroll report for the payroll period and make sure the report is accurate. The data from the report will be used to run payroll.

Open the Payroll app. Specify the parameters for the Payroll report (pay group, staff, time period, etc.) and select Generate report.

If a staff member works at multiple locations assigned to different payroll accounts, you will need to run payroll for each payroll account to pay the staff member for everything they earned across those locations.

Once you’ve generated the Payroll report:

Review the data in the report

Add any pay adjustments if needed, such as bonuses, tips, reimbursements, commission, etc.

If needed, learn how you can exclude a staff member’s tips from being paid out via Payroll Processing.

After reviewing the report, select Run payroll.

The payroll data is pulled from the Payroll report and is displayed for you to review. Select Next to view the payroll totals.

If needed, you can review the Payroll Journal and Cash Requirements reports before submitting payroll.

When you're ready to run payroll, select Submit payroll.

Link copied
Payroll notifications

The following automated email notifications will be sent for payroll:

A reminder email will be sent to all Admins on your account four days before it’s time to run payroll. This helps ensure your workers are paid on time.

A confirmation email will be sent to all Admins on your account after successfully processing payroll. This email will summarize the details of the payroll run, including payments, taxes, and total payroll.

A payday confirmation email will be sent to every worker included in a payroll run to let them know they just got paid. Workers will also receive their paystubs on the pay date.

To add a staff member, open the Staff Members app and select Add Staff Member.

Enter the staff member's details and select Create.

The staff member will receive their email invitation and staff notifications at the email address and phone number provided.

Admin users usually include business owners and managers who should have all permissions enabled. Normal users usually include service providers and front desk staff members who should not have all permissions enabled.

For service providers, enable the Is service provider toggle. You must enable this toggle to assign services to the staff member. If this toggle is enabled, you can also enable or disable the staff member in online booking.

Normally, only staff members who are enabled as service providers can be assigned to product sales. For staff members who are not service providers, such as front desk staff members, you can select Additional options and enable the Can be assigned to product sales toggle to make them eligible to be assigned to product sales.

Once you select Create to create the staff member, you can select Send to send them an email invitation so they can create their Mangomint login. If you are still setting up your account, we recommend you don't invite staff members until your account setup is complete.

If you select Not Now, you can invite the staff member later by selecting Send invite.

Hourly and Salary Compensation

You must be an Admin user to adjust a staff member’s compensation settings.

Hourly compensation

Hourly compensation is calculated as a flat rate per hour.

When you run the Payroll report, a staff member's hourly compensation is pulled from the scheduled hours of the staff member unless the Time Clock app is enabled, where it is pulled from the hours the staff member clocked in and out.

If the Time Clock app is disabled, the Include time blocks toggle is available, allowing you to include time blocks in a staff member's hourly compensation.

If a staff member has both an hourly rate and commission rate, you can use the Enable greater-of calculation toggle. This allows you to compare hourly and commission earnings on a daily basis or per pay period and only pay the staff member the higher amount. The lower compensation amount will be zeroed out in the Payroll report.

Salary compensation

The salary compensation method is available for Payroll Processing customers. Salary compensation is calculated using time intervals, such as $60,000 per year.

Enable the Works full-time toggle if the staff member works full time (8 hours a day, 5 days a week). If this toggle is disabled, you can specify the hours per day and days per week. This setting helps determine how much to pay the staff member per pay period and how to value time off.
