Paying Out a Staff Member's Tips in Cash

You can pay out a staff member's tips in cash from the cash drawer. This should be done at the end of the day or at the end of the staff member's shift.

Paying out a staff member's tips in cash does not affect the Payroll report.

If the staff member is not enrolled in Payroll Processing, or if the staff member has the Consider all tips as already paid setting disabled, you will need to add a negative pay adjustment for the tips paid out in cash.

If the staff member has the Consider all tips as already paid setting enabled, you do not need to add a negative pay adjustment since the staff member's tips will not be paid via Payroll Processing.

Link copied
Paying out a staff member's tips in cash

To pay out a staff member's tips in cash, open the Cash Drawer app and select New Pay-Out.

Select Show staff tips to view all the tips paid to each staff member, regardless of the payment method. This includes all tips paid with a credit card, cash, or any other payment method.

Select Pay out next to the staff member and select Save & Record. The payout will be deducted from your cash drawer total.

For non-credit card product returns, follow these steps.

For product exchanges, follow these steps.

Link copied
Complete a credit card product return

To complete a credit card product return, open the Sales app and select the original sale.

If the product was the only item in the sale, void the sale and refund the payment.

If the product was not the only item in the sale, update the sale and refund the payment.

Link copied
Void the sale and refund the payment

Before voiding the sale and refunding the payment, you will need to deduct product commission if the original sale was in a previous payroll period. To do this, locate the original sale in the Payroll report. Add the negative product commission amount to the current payroll period using a pay adjustment.

After deducting product commission, void the sale and refund the payment.

Open the Sales app and select the original sale.

Select Void from the "..." menu.

Select Continue.

Select the option for the original payment method and select Confirm to complete the refund and void the sale.

The client should see the refund in their bank account in a few business days, depending on their bank.

To help keep track of which products were returned, you can add a note to the sale or client timeline.

Select Go To Payments.

The remaining balance is the amount that needs to be refunded. In the example below, $45.00 needs to be refunded.

Select Refund from the "..." menu next to the credit card payment.

EARLY ACCESS RESOURCES
Refunding a Single Payment

In addition to completing refunds via the "..." menu for a sale, you can complete refunds via the "..." menu for single payments. This can be helpful for sales with multiple payments.

When refunding a single payment, you will only be able to refund to the original payment method or to the client’s account balance. If you’d like to refund the payment in a different way, such as cash, you will need to complete the refund from the "..." menu for the sale by using the Refund amount option.

Link copied
Refunding a single payment in a closed sale

To refund a single payment in a closed sale, view the sale and select Refund from the "..." menu next to the payment.

Select Just refund payment and select Start Refund.

To refund the full amount, leave the Amount to refund as is. To refund a partial amount, change the Amount to refund to the partial amount.

Specify whether to refund the amount to the original payment method or to the client's account balance.

Select Refund to complete the refund. The original payment will appear in your reports on the original payment date. The refund will appear in your reports on the date the refund was completed.

The sale will have a status of Closed (Remaining Balance). To ensure you have accurate reports, you will need to resolve the remaining balance. However, sales with a Closed (Remaining Balance) status are still closed and will still be included in Sales reports and the Payroll report.

### 11. Complete A Credit Card Refund

Complete a Credit Card Refund

This article covers how to complete a credit card refund in a closed sale if you use Mangomint’s payment processing.

There are two important steps to complete a credit card refund in a closed sale. The first step is to refund the payment, which returns the funds to the client. The second step is to void or update the sale, which ensures you have accurate reports.

Link copied
Refund the payment

To refund the payment, select Refund from the "..." menu next to the credit card payment.

To refund the full amount, leave the Amount to refund as is. To refund a partial amount, change the Amount to refund to the partial amount.

Specify whether to refund the amount to the client's credit card or the client's account balance.

Select Refund to complete the refund and return the funds to the client. If you refunded to the client's credit card, the client should see the refund in their bank account in a few business days, depending on their bank.

Once the refund is complete, a refund is added to the sale directly below the original payment.

For example, if you refunded an $85 credit card payment, a -$85 refund is added directly below the original payment. This ensures that both the original payment ($85) and the refund (-$85) appear in your Payment reports.

The original payment will appear in your reports on the original payment date, and the refund will appear in your reports on the date the refund was completed.

Link copied
Void or update the sale

After refunding the payment, the status of the sale in the Sales app is changed from Closed to Closed (Remaining Balance).

You will need to void or update the sale to account for the refunded amount and ensure you have accurate reports.

Void the sale if you completed a full refund of the sale total. This will remove the sale from your Sales reports.

Update the sale if you completed a partial refund of the sale total. This will update the sale in your Sales reports.

Link copied
Voiding a sale

To void a sale after completing a full refund of the sale total, open the Sales app and select the sale.

Select Void from the "..." menu.

Select Continue to void the sale.

The sale is now voided and won't be included in your Sales reports.

Link copied
Updating a sale

To update a sale after completing a partial refund of the sale total, open the Sales app and select the sale.

Select Reopen from the "..." menu.

Change the price to reflect the refunded amount. In the example below, we need to change the price from $100 to $20 because we refunded $80.

Select Go To Payments.

Select Complete to update the sale.

Add a tip to a sale via the Payments screen

Split tips between staff members

You can also add a tip to a sale using the client-facing Front Desk Display or Client Self Checkout.

Adding a tip to a sale via the Payments screen

To add a tip to a sale via the Payments screen, select Go To Payments.

Select a tip percentage or enter a custom tip amount. Learn how you can customize the tip percentages.

Complete the sale as you normally would.

Splitting tips between staff members

For sales with multiple staff members, Mangomint automatically splits the tip according to the services each staff member performs (default split). For example, John performs a $50 haircut and Sara performs a $100 color. If the client leaves a $30 tip, $10 would go to John, and $20 would go to Sara.

Instead of using the default split, you can select custom split to enter a specific tip amount for each staff member.

Learn how you can assign tips to assistants.

### 19. Use Redeem A Membership During Checkout

MEMBERSHIPS
Use a Service-Based Membership During Checkout

To redeem a service-based membership during checkout, begin the checkout from the calendar or Sales app.

Add any services or products to the checkout and select Apply a membership.

Select Apply next to the membership that should be used.

If the membership is applied to a higher-priced service, the client will only need to pay the difference. For example, if the client has a membership for a regular facial ($50), they can apply the membership towards a premium facial ($100) and only pay the difference.

If the staff member has a custom service price, their service price will be changed to match the value of the applied membership.

Complete the checkout as you normally would. If there is no total due, learn how you can still collect a tip. The tip will be calculated based on the membership value.

### 20. How Do I Handle Product Exchanges

**Source**: [https://www.mangomint.com/learn/how-do-i-handle-product-exchanges/](https://www.mangomint.com/learn/how-do-i-handle-product-exchanges/)

#### Content

HOME
SALES & CHECKOUT
REFUNDS & RETURNS
Product Exchanges

Before completing a product exchange, determine if you need to adjust product commission. You will need to adjust product commission if the products being exchanged have different prices and the original sale was in a previous payroll period.

To do this, locate the original sale in the Payroll report and make a note of how much product commission the staff member was paid for the products being exchanged. You will need to know this amount once the exchange is complete.

Link copied
Complete a product exchange

To complete a product exchange, open the Sales app and select the original sale.

Select Reopen from the "..." menu.

Delete the product if the full quantity is being exchanged, or reduce the quantity by how many products are being exchanged.

Add the new product to the sale. If you pay your staff members product commission, select the staff member who originally sold the product.

Select Go To Payments.

If the new product has a higher price, the client will need to pay the difference to complete the exchange.

If the new product has a lower price, the remaining balance will be negative. You will need to refund this amount to the client. In the example below, $6.00 needs to be refunded.

If you need to complete a refund for the remaining balance, select Reverse or Refund from the "..." menu next to the payment.

Complete the refund for the remaining balance.

Select Complete to close the sale and complete the exchange.

The returned product will be added back to your inventory count. If the product should not be added back to your inventory (e.g. damaged products), you will need to manually update your inventory count to remove the product.

To help keep track of which products were exchanged, you can add a note to the sale or client timeline.

Link copied
Adjusting product commission

If you need to adjust product commission after completing the exchange, locate the original sale in the Payroll report.

Note the updated commission amount and add a pay adjustment to the current payroll period for the difference. For example, if the commission amount was updated from $15 to $10, add a -$5 pay adjustment to the current payroll period.

Voiding a Sale

Voiding a sale helps ensure your reports include accurate information.

When voiding a sale, you can refund or reverse any payments in the sale, including credit card payments.

Instead of voiding an entire sale, learn how you can refund or reverse individual payments in a sale.

Link copied
Voiding a sale

To void a sale, open the Sales app and select the sale to void.

Select Void from the "..." menu.

If the sale has any payments that have not been refunded or reversed, you can refund or reverse each payment.

Credit card payments can be refunded, while non-credit card payments can be reversed.

Once you’ve specified which payments to refund or reverse, the sale will be voided.

The original payments will appear in your reports on the original payment date. Refunds and reversals will appear in your reports on the date they were completed.

Reversing a gift card payment will automatically return the funds to the gift card.

Reversing a cash payment will immediately affect the expected balance of the cash drawer. For example, if you reverse an $80 cash payment, $80 will be immediately deducted from the cash drawer balance.

If you skipped refunding or reversing any payments in the sale, the sale will have a status of Voided (Remaining Payments). This allows you to filter the Sales app to find voided sales that still have payments that may need to be refunded.

### 25. How To Use Redeem A Package During Checkout

PACKAGES
Using a Package During Checkout

To redeem a package during checkout, begin a checkout from the calendar or Sales app.

Add the service(s) to the checkout and select Apply a package.

Select Apply next to the package that should be used.

If the package is applied to a higher-priced service, the client will only need to pay the difference. For example, if the client has a package for a regular facial ($40), they can apply the package towards a premium facial ($100) and only pay the difference.

If the staff member has a custom service price, their service price will be changed to match the value of the applied package.

Complete the checkout as you normally would. If there is no total due, learn how you can still collect a tip. The tip will be calculated based on the package value.

### 27. Completing A Refund

**Source**: [https://www.mangomint.com/learn/completing-a-refund/](https://www.mangomint.com/learn/completing-a-refund/)

EARLY ACCESS RESOURCES
Completing a Refund
IN THIS ARTICLE
Completing a refund
Viewing refunds in the Sales app
Discarding a refund

When completing a refund, you can complete all steps of the refund process in one streamlined workflow, including:

Returning funds to the client

Adjusting staff member commission

Specifying whether returned products should be added back to your inventory count

To complete refunds, you must be an Admin user, or you must have the Can refund sales (open and closed) or Can refund open sales permission enabled in Staff Member settings.

Link copied
Completing a refund

To complete a refund, view the sale and select Refund from the "..." menu.

Specify how to complete the refund.

Refund line items: This option allows you to specify line items that should be fully or partially refunded. This option will guide you through all steps of the refund process, including adjusting commission, adding products back to your inventory, and more. This will ensure you have accurate reports.

Refund amount: This option allows you to specify an amount that should be refunded without having to choose line items. While this option is helpful if you need to quickly refund the client, the sale will have a remaining balance once the refund is complete. You will need to resolve the remaining balance to ensure you have accurate reports.

Note: 

If you are an Admin user and would prefer to complete all the steps of the refund process yourself (adjusting commission, inventory, etc.), you can have staff members use the Refund amount option. This will only allow staff members to return funds to the client, and it will allow you to complete all the remaining steps yourself afterward (adjusting commission, inventory, etc.) by resolving the remaining balance.

Link copied
Refund line items

If you selected Refund line items, you will be guided through all steps of the refund process.

In the example below:

A service, product, and tip are fully refunded. You can also specify whether a line item should only be partially refunded. If you partially refund a service or product and choose to claw back commission, the staff member will only earn commission on the non-refunded amount.

The staff member’s service and product commission are clawed back. This means the staff member will not earn commission on the refunded service or product. The adjusted commission amount will be reflected in the Payroll report for the date the refund was completed, not the original sale date.

The Quantity to restock for the product is changed to 0. This means the product will not be added back to inventory (e.g. damaged products).

The payment is refunded to the original payment method. You can also choose to refund the payment in a different way, such as cash or a gift card.

After completing the refund, the original payment will appear in your reports on the original payment date. The refund will appear in your reports on the date the refund was completed.

Link copied
Refund amount

If you selected Refund amount, you can specify an amount that should be refunded. While this option is helpful if you need to quickly refund the client, the sale will have a remaining balance once the refund is complete. You will need to resolve the remaining balance to ensure you have accurate reports.

In the example below, instead of refunding the entire amount, only $25 is refunded to the original payment method. You can also choose to refund the amount in a different way, such as cash or a gift card.

After completing the refund, the original payment will appear in your reports on the original payment date. The refund will appear in your reports on the date the refund was completed.

Link copied
Viewing refunds in the Sales app

Refunds are listed separately from sales in the Sales app.

In the Sales app:

Refunds have a refund number separate from the sale number. When viewing a refund, the corresponding sale number is included for reference.

Refunds have a negative total.

Sales that were refunded include the refund details.

The table below provides more details on the different statuses in the Sales app.

Link copied

Reversing a Payment
IN THIS ARTICLE
Reversing a payment
What does the Closed (Remaining Balance) status mean?
How does reversing a payment affect reports?

Reversing (voiding) a payment helps ensure your reports and sales include accurate information.

Instead of reversing payments individually, you can also reverse payments when voiding a sale.

Link copied
Reversing a payment

To reverse a payment, open the Sales app and select the sale with the payment to reverse.

Select Reverse from the "..." menu next to the payment. The Reverse option is not available for credit card payments. Instead, credit card payments can be refunded.

To reverse the full amount, leave the Amount to reverse as is. To reverse a partial amount, change the Amount to reverse to the partial amount.

Specify whether to reverse the amount to the original payment method or the client's account balance.

Select Reverse to complete the reversal.

The original payment will appear in your reports on the original payment date. The reversal will appear in your reports on the date it was completed.

Reversing a gift card payment will automatically return the funds to the gift card.

Reversing a cash payment will immediately affect the expected balance of the cash drawer. For example, if you reverse an $80 cash payment, $80 will be immediately deducted from the cash drawer balance.

Link copied
What does the Closed (Remaining Balance) status mean?

If you reversed a payment in a closed sale, the sale will have a status of Closed (Remaining Balance). This means the sale is still closed, but there is now a remaining balance because a payment was reversed.

You can either leave the sale as Closed (Remaining Balance), or you can change the sale back to a Closed status by:

Reopening the sale and collecting payment for the remaining balance

Reopening the sale and changing the price of the line items to account for the reversed payment

Sales with a Closed (Remaining Balance) status will still be included in Sales reports and the Payroll report.

To find sales with a Closed (Remaining Balance) status, you can filter the Sales app.

Link copied
How does reversing a payment affect reports?

The following reports are affected when a payment is reversed:

Payment Summary and Payment Details: These reports include reversal payments.

Cash Drawer Activity: This report includes reversed cash payments.

Gift Card Usage: This report includes reversed gift card payments.

Gift Card Balances: This report includes updated gift card balances when gift card payments are reversed. If a gift card payment is reversed, the funds are automatically returned to the gift card.

Complete a Product Return and Refund to the Client Account Balance

To complete a product return and refund to the client's account balance, open the Sales app and select New Checkout.

Select the client and add the product that is being returned.

Update the quantity to a negative quantity to represent how many products are being returned.

If you pay your staff members product commission, select the staff member who originally sold the product. This will deduct the product commission for the appropriate staff member.

Select Go To Payments.

Select Account Balance.

Select Confirm to refund the amount to the client’s account balance. The client's account balance can now be used as a payment method for an appointment or sale.

The returned product will be added back to your inventory count. If the product should not be added back to your inventory (e.g. damaged products), you will need to manually update your inventory count to remove the returned product.
