Details tab

To create an offer, you must be an Admin user, or you must have the Can manage offers permission enabled in Staff Member settings.

Open the Offers app and select Create Offer. Customize your offer using the Details, Discounts, and Advanced tabs.

Link copied
Details tab

In the Details tab, specify how the offer should be applied. The offer Name will be displayed on the receipt, while the Description is only visible internally.

An offer can be applied in the following ways:

Only by staff members: Staff members can apply the offer manually during checkout by selecting More > Offer.

With an offer code: Clients will receive the discount if they entered the offer code (discount code) via online booking as shown below. This field will display in online booking if you have any active offers with offer codes.

Automatically: The offer will be applied automatically during checkout based on the offer settings.

You can limit when an offer can be used based on the following:

Appointment date/time: Clients will receive the discount based on when they complete their appointment.

Booking date: Clients will receive the discount based on when they book their appointment.

Sale date: Clients will receive the discount based on the sale date. This is useful for sales completed via the Sales app without an appointment.

You can also limit an offer to the following:

Discounts tab

In the Discounts tab, specify the type of discount included in the offer.

For Service discounts, the discount will be applied to the service price. The service price includes any selected service customizations. You can set the discount to apply to all services, or you can select specific services or service categories. You can also add multiple discounts, such as 30% off all facials and 20% off all massages.

For Product discounts, the discount will be applied to the price of the product. You can set the discount to apply to all products, or you can select specific products or product categories.

For Entire sale discounts, the discount will be applied to the sale total. This includes sales with gift cards and packages. Entire sale discounts are limited to dollar-amount discounts (e.g. $20 off the entire sale) and do not support percentage discounts (e.g. 15% off the entire sale). For Entire sale discounts, you cannot add multiple discounts to the offer, as Entire sale discounts cannot be combined with other discounts.

To create an offer for a free service or product, select the service or product and set the discount to 100%. In the example below, the client will receive a free hair oil when they spend $100 or more.

Link copied
Advanced tab

In the Advanced tab, specify which locations are eligible for the offer and select which price to use for calculating commission. Staff members can receive commission for the regular price or the discounted price.

Once you’re finished creating the offer, select Enable to enable the offer.

Once you create and enable an offer, the offer will be applied during checkout based on the offer settings.

Offers can be applied in multiple ways, including:

Apply an offer manually

Apply an offer via an offer code in online booking

Apply an offer automatically

You can also apply multiple offers to the same checkout.

Link copied
Apply an offer manually

To apply an offer manually during checkout, begin the checkout as you normally would.

Select More > Offer and choose from the available offers. If there are no items in the checkout eligible for the applied offer, the applied offer will have no effect. The offer will display a message indicating why the discount was not applied.

Link copied
Apply an offer via an offer code in online booking

To apply an offer via an offer code in online booking, clients can enter the offer code in the Promo code field.

Once the client enters the offer code, the offer will be saved with their appointment. During checkout, the offer will be applied automatically.

If a full pre-payment is required, the discount will be applied during online booking.

Link copied
Apply an offer automatically

If you create an offer that is applied automatically during checkout, you can view the details of the applied offer, including the discount amount.

Link copied
Apply multiple offers to the same checkout

You can only apply one offer to each line item. If a line item is eligible for multiple offers, the offer with the higher discount will be used.

In the example below, the Facial Special and Loyalty Discount offers were applied to the two line items in the sale. The sale was also eligible for a sale-level offer.

When the sale-level offer was applied, the previous discounts were removed because the sale-level offer resulted in a higher overall discount, which can be viewed by selecting Go To Payments.
