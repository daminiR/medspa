### 5. How Do I Fix An Accidentally Voided Sale

**Source**: [https://www.mangomint.com/learn/how-do-i-fix-an-accidentally-voided-sale/](https://www.mangomint.com/learn/how-do-i-fix-an-accidentally-voided-sale/)

Fixing an Accidentally Voided Sale

If a sale is accidentally voided, you can add it back into your reports by creating a new sale.

To create a new sale that is identical to the voided sale, begin by opening the Sales app and selecting New Checkout.

If the sale was assigned to a specific client, make sure you select the same client.

If the sale included a service or product assigned to a specific staff member, make sure you assign the same staff member.

Voided sale:
Link copied
New sale:

Make sure the total of the new sale matches the total of the voided sale, including any tips.

Close the new sale using the Other payment button. You can add a note about the voided sale for reference. Closing a sale using the Other payment button will not charge the client—it simply records the sale in Mangomint.

If the new sale was closed on a different date than the voided sale, change the date of the new sale to reflect when the original payment was collected. To do this, open the Sales app and select the new sale.

Select Change Date from the "..." menu and specify the date when the original payment was collected.

The sale is now updated, and your reports will reflect the correct information.

Launch date

Your launch date is the date you will start to use Mangomint as your day-to-day scheduling software and turn off your previous scheduling software. Picking a launch date will help you determine which future appointments from your previous scheduling software you will need to transfer into Mangomint. You only need to transfer future appointments from your launch date onward.

Link copied
Transfer future appointments

If you are transferring to Mangomint from a previous scheduling software, you will need to manually transfer future appointments (from your launch date onward) into Mangomint.

Before transferring future appointments, disable your automated messages in Mangomint so that your clients don’t receive notifications as you work through the transfer process.

If you are importing your client list into Mangomint, please wait until we have finished importing clients before transferring appointments.

During the transfer process, keep the appointments up to date in both your previous software and Mangomint. Any change to a future appointment (such as rescheduling or cancellation) should be made in both systems.

### 13. Resolving A Remaining Balance

EARLY ACCESS RESOURCES
Resolving a Remaining Balance

When a refund is completed in a closed sale, the sale will have a status of Closed (Remaining Balance) if:

An amount was refunded instead of line items.

The sale had multiple payments, and only a single payment was refunded.

To ensure you have accurate reports, you will need to resolve the remaining balance. However, sales with a Closed (Remaining Balance) status are still closed and will still be included in Sales reports and the Payroll report.

Link copied
Resolving a remaining balance

To resolve a remaining balance in a closed sale, select the sale and specify how to resolve the balance.

Select refunded items: This option allows you to assign the refunded amount to specific line items in the sale, allowing you to also adjust commission, add products back to your inventory, and more.

Collect payment: This option allows you to collect a new payment for the refunded amount. This is helpful if the client requested a refund so they could use a different payment method.

Link copied
Select refunded items

If you chose Select refunded items, you can resolve the remaining balance by assigning the refunded amount to specific line items in the sale.

A separate refund will be created for the sale, which will keep track of how the balance was resolved and which line items were refunded.

The status of the sale will change to Closed (Partially Refunded) or Closed (Refunded), depending on whether the sale is partially or fully refunded.

Link copied
Collect payment

If you chose Collect payment, you can resolve the remaining balance by collecting a new payment for the refunded amount. This is helpful if the client requested a refund so they could use a different payment method.

Once the payment is complete and the balance is resolved, the status of the sale will change to Closed.

Set Up Alternating Hours for Staff Members (Bi-weekly Schedules)

You can create bi-weekly schedules in Mangomint for staff members who alternate hours. To do this, add a weekly shift for the staff member, and then add a time block that repeats every two weeks to override the shift accordingly.

Link copied
Creating bi-weekly schedules

To create a bi-weekly schedule for a staff member, begin by adding the staff member's weekly shift.

After adding the weekly shift, override the shift by adding a time block that repeats every two weeks. For example, if the staff member only works every other Monday, you would block their entire Monday shift every other week.

To add a time block that repeats every two weeks, locate the staff member on the calendar and select the start date/time for the time block. Select Create time block.

Select a duration for the time block. Enter a reason for the time block, such as Bi-weekly schedule. Select Create Time Block.

Once the time block is created, select Make Repeating from the "..." menu.

Enable the Repeat this time block toggle and select Every 2 weeks. Select Save.

CASH DRAWER
Add a New Count

Adding a new count resets any previous cash drawer balance. The new count will be used as the starting balance in your cash drawer.

As a best practice, add a new count every day or at the beginning of a shift to ensure the cash drawer balance matches the amount in the physical cash drawer.

Link copied
Adding a new count

To add a new count, open the Cash Drawer app and select New Count.

In the New Count details, enter the number of bills and coins in the drawer. Add any additional notes (optional).

Note: 

Instead of entering the number of bills and coins, you can simply enter the total cash drawer amount in the Other field.

Select Complete Count to add the new count.

Expected: The amount that the physical cash drawer should have based on the previous balance, cash payments (including partial cash payments), pay-ins, and pay-outs.

Actual: The New Count amount. This should match the amount in your physical cash drawer. If it does not, make sure all pay-ins and pay-outs were correctly logged.

ABOUT MANGOMINT
Using Mangomint with a Booth Renter or Hybrid Model

Mangomint can support businesses that have a booth rental or hybrid model.

Booth renters are service providers who are usually charged a flat or variable fee to rent space (booth, chair, room, etc.) within a salon, spa, or studio instead of getting paid an hourly rate or commission by the business.

A hybrid model refers to a business that has booth renters and other types of workers, including service providers who are paid hourly or commission.

Businesses that have a booth renter or hybrid model can use one Mangomint account to easily manage all their workers.

To learn more about managing booth renter and hybrid models, watch our on-demand Booth Renter & Hybrid Models video.

Link copied
Mangomint features for booth renter & hybrid models

Mangomint includes the following features that can be used with booth renter and hybrid models:

Payment (merchant) accounts: Booth renters can have their own payment (merchant) account, allowing them to receive payments directly to their own bank account.

Taking payments at the booth or on the go: Booth renters can process payments at their booth or on the go by connecting their own card reader to their iPhone or iPad.

Direct booking links: Clients can book directly with a booth renter by using the booth renter’s direct booking link.

Client ownership: Booth renters can be assigned as the owner of a client. This ensures they will only have access to their own clients.

Product ownership: Booth renters can be assigned as the owner of a product. This ensures they will receive the funds when a product they own is sold.

Collecting rent payments from booth renters: You can collect rent payments from booth renters automatically using a membership.

Link copied
Payment (merchant) accounts

Payment accounts allow booth renters to receive payments directly to their own bank account.

To set up a payment account for a booth renter, an Admin will first need to create the payment account. Then, the booth renter can complete the process by signing up for the payment account.

Booth renters can access their assigned payment account to see how much they made. They will be paid according to the payout schedule. Booth renters are only responsible for per-transaction fees, which will be deducted from their payouts.

By default, all gift card, package, and membership sales go into the primary payment account for the business, even if the booth renter has their own payment account. Any gift cards, packages, or memberships that are redeemed will need to be paid out to the booth renter separately.

Link copied
Taking payments at the booth or on the go

Booth renters can process payments using a Front Desk Display, or they can process payments at their booth using:

Client Self Checkout

A card reader connected to their iPhone or iPad

A third-party payment processor

Link copied
Direct booking links

Direct booking links allow clients to book directly with a booth renter. These links can be sent to clients, added to your website, and more.

Learn more about using direct booking links for individual staff members.

Link copied
Client ownership

Client ownership settings allow booth renters to only have access to their own clients. All other clients will be hidden.

Learn how to adjust client ownership settings.

Link copied
Product ownership

Product ownership settings allow booth renters to receive the funds when a product they own is sold.

By default, all product sales go into the primary payment account for the business. However, if a product has an owner, the product sale will be routed to the product owner’s payment account.

Any product commission will need to be paid out to the booth renter separately.

Learn how to adjust product ownership settings.

Link copied
Collecting rent payments from booth renters

You can collect rent payments from booth renters using a membership. This can be helpful if you want to automatically collect rent payments from booth renters when rent is due. This method works best when booth renters are charged the same amount of rent each billing period.

To charge and collect rent via Mangomint using a membership, you will need to:

Create a booth rent service and set the service price to the rent amount.

Create a booth rent membership plan. Set the billing frequency to match how often you charge rent, disable the Charge service tax toggle, and add the booth rent service to the membership plan.

Create a client profile for each booth renter.

Start a new booth rent membership for each booth renter. You can specify whether to collect membership payments automatically or manually for each booth renter.

Membership payments are considered deferred revenue. They will appear in the Membership Payments report, but they will not appear in the Sales Summary report unless the membership services are redeemed.

For membership payments collected via Mangomint’s payment processing, you will be paid out for the membership payments according to your regular payout schedule.
