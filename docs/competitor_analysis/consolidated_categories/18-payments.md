### 3. Best Practices Credit Card Payments

Cancellation policy and receipts

This article provides best practices for taking credit card payments. By following these best practices, you can help prevent payment disputes.

Link copied
Card-present transactions

Card-present transactions include any transaction where a card is used in person (tap, insert, or swipe). Transactions where a card is used in person are less likely to be disputed than transactions where a card is not used in person.

Here are some best practices for card-present transactions:

Ask clients to tap or insert their card instead of swiping their card. EMV cards (chip cards) are more secure than cards without a chip.

Ask clients for a signature during checkout. Learn how to require a signature during checkout on your Front Desk Display.

Verify the client’s photo ID to confirm their name matches the name on the card being used.

Provide a receipt.

Link copied
Card-not-present transactions

Card-not-present transactions include any transaction where a card is not used in person, including cards on file and online payments/deposits.

Here are some best practices for card-not-present transactions:

Use Express Booking™ to collect credit card information from clients when booking appointments. With Express Booking™, you can send a link to clients via text message where they must enter their information, add a credit card on file (if required), and accept your cancellation policy in order to complete a booking. As part of completing the booking, we collect information including the IP address, device model, and exact cancellation policy that was accepted. This information can later be used as evidence when fighting a dispute.

Verify the client’s photo ID on the day of the appointment to confirm their name matches the name on the card being used.

Link copied
Large transactions

We recommend you collect the following documentation for any sale over $2,000. You can use the Forms app to collect digital forms.

Signed contract or purchase agreement. Please include as many details as possible. The more details you include about a sale, the better equipped the Mangomint team is to help you if a dispute occurs.

Signed credit card authorization form for the total amount to be paid.

Copy of the client’s ID to confirm the client’s name matches the name on the card being used.

For security purposes, if you complete a large transaction, the Mangomint team may contact you to request documentation.

Link copied
Cancellation policy and r
eceipts

We recommend you cover returns, exchanges, and refunds in your cancellation policy, including a clear timeframe for when they can be done. If clients will be charged for no-shows or cancellations, make sure that is clearly stated in your cancellation policy. Learn more about creating a cancellation policy and adding it to Mangomint.

We also recommend your receipts include the following information:

Your contact information including address, email, and phone number. This helps increase the chance that clients will contact you directly if there is an issue rather than contacting their bank to file a dispute. To manage your contact information included on your receipts, open the Settings app and select Business Setup > Locations. Learn more about sending and printing receipts.

A recognizable business name and description of goods/services sold. This helps clients recognize your business name on their bank statements and identify the exact goods/services purchased. To update your business name that displays on a client’s bank statement, open the Settings app. Select Payments & Checkout > Payment Accounts > Manage account and update your Statement descriptor.

Signing Up for Payment Processing

Our integrated payment option for card payments allows you to accept all major credit cards with no monthly charges or hidden fees, and it gives you access to features such as:

Cards on file

Online booking pre-payments & deposits

Express Booking™

Client Self Checkout

To sign up for payment processing, open the Settings app and go to Payments & Checkout > Payment Accounts > Primary Account to create your payment account.

If you have multiple locations, you can:

Use one payment account for all your locations: This allows you to combine your payouts for all locations into one payout. To do this, create a payment account for one location, then contact chat support to link your other locations to the same payment account.

Use different payment accounts for each location: This is only required if each location has a different EIN, or if you want to deposit your payouts for each location into different bank accounts. With this option, you can keep your payouts for each location separate. To use this option, select the Locations dropdown and create a payment account for each location. You will need to sign up using a different email for each location.

Select Manage account > Sign up now. You will be redirected to a new page where you can begin your application.

Begin your application by following the instructions to verify your phone number.

Continue your application by following the provided instructions.

When completing your application:

The combination of your Legal Business Name and EIN must exactly match the one listed on your IRS documents.

The most common industries are:

Personal services > Health and beauty spas

Personal services > Salons or barbers

If you don't have a business website, you can enter your business social media profile.

The bank account information you enter will be used for your payouts. A payout is the transfer of funds from your payment account to the bank account entered.

Once you've entered all the required information, submit your application to create your payment account.

If you have any questions about the application process, please reach out to chat support.

iPad stand (short and tall versions can be ordered from the Mangomint Store)

Bluetooth card reader (card reader and dock can be ordered from the Mangomint Store)

A device to trigger payments on the Front Desk Display, such as a computer, phone, or tablet (including Android devices)

Split Payments Between Multiple Payment Methods

During checkout, you can split payments between multiple payment methods.

To split a payment, begin the checkout as you normally would.

On the Payments screen, enter the amount to charge the first payment method. Then, select the payment type to complete the partial payment. Partial payments are included immediately in the Payment Summary and Payment Details reports. Partial cash payments will also immediately affect the cash drawer.

After a successful partial payment, the system automatically calculates the remaining balance. Charge the remaining balance to a different payment method to complete the sale.

The closed sale will show how the payments were split up.

Primary account

The primary account is the default payment account used to accept payments for the business. All card transactions will be processed using this payment account. Most businesses only need one primary account to process payments.

Learn how to set up your primary account.

Additional payment accounts

Additional payment accounts can be used to automatically direct payments to a payment account owned by a staff member. This is helpful for businesses that do not handle payments for independent contractors or booth renters.

With this setup, staff members can have their own payment accounts and payment processors. Any checkout with the assigned staff member automatically directs payment to that staff member's payment account.

CREDIT CARDS
Payment Disputes

A dispute (also known as a chargeback) occurs when a client asks their bank to reverse a charge on their credit card.

When a dispute occurs, the transaction will be reversed, and you will be charged a dispute fee.

The Mangomint team will contact you and guide you through the next steps. You can either accept the dispute and allow the client to keep the funds, or you can fight the dispute (most common).

Link copied
Gathering evidence to fight a dispute

If you choose to fight a dispute, the Mangomint team will work with you to gather evidence that can help increase your chance of winning the dispute. The more detailed evidence you can provide, the better your chance of winning the dispute.

Evidence that can help you win a dispute includes:

Signed documentation such as contracts, service agreements, or credit card receipts

Communications with the client before or after the service, including screenshots of texts or emails

Photos, videos, or security camera footage of the client receiving the service

Proof that the credit card owner was the person who received the service

A formal written statement from you describing the situation

Documentation stored in Mangomint such as policies, appointment reminders, etc. The Mangomint team will help you gather this information.

The outcome of a dispute will be determined by the bank that issued the client’s credit card. Unfortunately, if the bank determines you’ve lost a dispute, that decision is final.

Link copied
Preventing disputes

Here are some steps you can take to help prevent disputes/chargebacks:

Require clients to agree to your cancellation policy. If clients will be charged for no-shows or cancellations, make sure it is clearly stated in your cancellation policy.

Require clients to sign documentation for large transactions.

Process refunds in a timely manner. We recommend refunding to the client's original payment method to help minimize the risk of a dispute.

Cancel recurring payments (such as memberships) in a timely manner according to the cancellation date requested by the client.

If you have any questions about disputes, please reach out to chat support.

Connecting a Card Reader Directly to Your iPhone or iPad

You can connect your Mangomint card reader directly to your iPhone or iPad.

With a direct connection:

Booth renters or service providers can collect their own payments at the business or on the go.

You can check out clients and view the calendar on the same iPhone or iPad.

To set up a direct connection, you will need an iPhone or iPad and a Bluetooth card reader. Card readers can be ordered from the Mangomint Store.

Learn more about the differences between a direct connection and the Front Desk Display.

Link copied
Connecting your card reader to your iPhone or iPad

To set up a direct connection, open the Mangomint app on your iPhone or iPad.

Open the menu and tap Card Readers. The Card Readers option is only available if you have signed up for payment processing.

Tap Connect a card reader.

Turn on the card reader and make sure it's charged. Place the card reader close to your iPhone or iPad and tap Continue.

Tap Continue. If Bluetooth is disabled, you are prompted to enable it. The app will then search for available card readers.

Once you see your card reader in the list, tap Connect. If you see multiple card readers, select the one that matches your card reader's serial number. The serial number is printed on the back of the card reader.

If your card reader needs a firmware update, the app will automatically update the firmware for you.

If the card reader connection was successful, you will see the message below. Tap Okay. You are now ready to use your card reader to accept payments.

Setting Up Your Front Desk Display

This article covers how to set up your iPad to be used for the Front Desk Display. The client-facing Front Desk Display allows clients to view their total, add a tip, pay, sign, and choose a receipt.

Here's what you'll need:

Apple iPad (iOS 12 or later). View a list of supported iPad models.

iPad stand. Short and tall stands can be ordered from the Mangomint Store.

Bluetooth card reader. Card reader and dock can be ordered from the Mangomint Store.

A device to trigger payments on the Front Desk Display, such as a computer, phone, or tablet, including Android devices.

Before you begin:

Make sure your iPad has Bluetooth enabled and is connected to Wi-Fi. Mobile data can also be used instead of Wi-Fi.

Make sure your card reader is plugged in and charging.

Link copied
Setting Up Your Front Desk Display

On your iPad, download the Mangomint app from the App Store.

Open the app on your iPad and tap Front desk mode. A 4-digit pairing code is displayed.

On your computer/separate device, ensure you are logged in as an Admin user.

Open the Settings app and select Payments & Checkout > Front Desk Displays.

Select Connect a display.

Select Enter pairing code.

Enter the 4-digit pairing code shown on your iPad and select Continue.

If you have multiple locations, select the location(s) that will use this device and select Continue.

If the connection is successful, you will see a confirmation message.

Once you have successfully connected your Front Desk Display to your Mangomint account, connect your Bluetooth card reader to your iPad.

On your iPad, tap Connect a bluetooth card reader.

Tap Connect a card reader.

Turn on the card reader and make sure it's charged. Place the card reader close to your iPad and tap Continue.

Tap Continue. The app will search for available card readers.

Once you see your card reader in the list, tap Connect. If you see multiple card readers, select the one that matches your card reader's serial number. The serial number is printed on the back of the card reader.

If the card reader connection is successful, you will see a confirmation message. Tap Okay.

Once your card reader is connected, enable Kiosk Mode on your iPad. Kiosk Mode ensures the iPad stays locked on the Mangomint app and restricts users from accessing other apps, settings, and device functionalities.

Collect a Manual Deposit

To collect a manual deposit for a client's appointment, begin the checkout for the appointment. This will create an open sale that will be closed once the appointment is completed.

Deposits are not included in the Payroll report or Sales reports until the service is completed and the sale is closed. However, deposits are included immediately in the Payment Summary and Payment Details reports. Cash deposits will also immediately affect the cash drawer.

Collecting a manual deposit

To collect a manual deposit, select the appointment on the calendar. Select Checkout from the "..." menu.

Select Go To Payments. Change the Amount to charge to the deposit amount and complete the payment.

After a successful payment, the system automatically calculates the remaining balance.

On the day of the appointment, continue checking out the appointment as you normally would.
