Create a Group Booking from the Calendar

Once you’ve enabled group booking, you can create a group booking from the calendar. This article covers how to create a group booking with new appointments only. To create a group booking from existing appointments, follow these steps.

To create a group booking from the calendar, select Group Appointment and add the first appointment to the group.

Continue adding appointments to the group as needed by selecting Add Appointment. Each client will have their own appointment on the calendar, which allows them to receive their own appointment confirmation, reminders, and forms.

Every group booking has one client who is the primary contact for the group. You can change the primary contact as needed by selecting Make Primary Contact next to the new primary contact.

For Express Booking™, the primary contact will be the client who receives the text message to complete the group booking for all clients.

Learn more about primary contacts for group bookings.

Once you’ve added all the appointments to the group, select Book Appointments to create the group booking.

Each client in the group will receive their own appointment confirmation and reminders that include any forms the client needs to complete.

The primary contact’s confirmation email will include the appointment details for each client in the group.

The confirmation emails for the other clients in the group will specify that their appointment was booked by the primary contact.

On the calendar, all the appointments in the group will have a group appointment icon. Group bookings created from online booking will also have the group appointment icon.

Once you’ve created the group booking, learn how you can update the group booking or check in and check out the group booking.

Check In and Check Out a Group Booking

Once a group booking is created from the calendar or online booking, you can check in and check out clients individually or all together.

Link copied
Checking in a group booking

To check in a group booking, you can check in clients individually or all together.

Checking in clients individually can be helpful if one client is running late and needs to begin their appointment later than the rest of the group.

Checking in clients all together is helpful if all clients have arrived and are ready to begin their appointment.

To check in an individual client, select the client’s appointment and select Check-In.

To check in clients all together, select the group on the calendar and select Check-In.

Link copied
Checking out a group booking

To check out a group booking, you can check out clients in multiple ways.

Check out clients individually: This is helpful if each client wants to pay for their own appointment. This allows each client to use their own membership, package, gift card, and client account balance.

Check out clients all together: This is helpful if one client is paying for everyone, or if multiple clients want to split the payment. This also allows the client assigned to the sale to apply their own membership or package to other clients in the checkout. The client assigned to the sale can also use their own gift card and client account balance as a payment method.

Check out a combination of clients: For example, for a group of four, three clients may want to check out together, while the fourth client wants to check out separately.

To check out an individual client, select the client’s appointment and select Checkout. Complete the checkout as you normally would.

To check out clients all together, select the group on the calendar and select Checkout. Complete the checkout as you normally would. Learn how you can split the payment between multiple payment methods if needed.

To check out a combination of clients, select the group on the calendar and select Checkout.

Remove appointments from the checkout as needed and complete the checkout as you normally would. Any client who has already checked out will not be included in the group checkout.

### 7. Create A Group Booking From Online Booking

CALENDAR & APPOINTMENTS
GROUP BOOKING
Create a Group Booking from Online Booking

Once you’ve enabled group appointments in online booking, clients can book group appointments online.

When booking a group appointment online, the booking client will begin by selecting:

How many guests are in the group

The service, service customizations, and service provider for each guest

The day and time for the group appointment

After selecting the day and time for the group appointment, the booking client will enter contact information for themselves and everyone in the group. This allows everyone in the group to receive their own appointment confirmation, reminders, and forms.

The booking client can also enter comments for specific clients and for the entire group. These comments will appear in the appointment details on the calendar.

The booking client will specify a primary contact for the group. While clients cannot change the primary contact once the group appointment is booked, staff members can change the primary contact from the calendar as needed.

Each client in a group booking will be able to view their appointment in their client portal. However, only the primary contact can:

Self-reschedule the entire group. Individual appointments in a group cannot be self-rescheduled.

Self-cancel the entire group and individual appointments in the group. The primary contact’s appointment can only be canceled if the entire group is canceled.

If any deposits are required, the booking client will need to pay all of the deposits for each guest. All of the deposits will be combined into one deposit for the booking client to pay in order to book the group appointment.

Once the group appointment is booked:

Each client in the group will receive their own appointment confirmation and reminders that include any forms the client needs to complete.

The primary contact’s confirmation email will include the appointment details for each client in the group. The confirmation emails for the other clients in the group will specify that their appointment was booked by the primary contact.

Learn how you can update the group booking from the calendar or check in and check out the group booking.

Client Self Check-In

Clients with existing appointments can check in to the waiting room themselves using Client Self Check-In. This is helpful for businesses that do not have front desk staff available to check in clients.

To allow clients to check in to the waiting room themselves, open the Settings app. Select Automated Messages > Check-In Process and add the Client Self Check-In automated message.

You can customize the Client Self Check-In automated message by enabling the Ask clients to wait outside toggle. When enabled, clients will be asked to wait outside once they check in.

Once the Client Self Check-In automated message is added, clients will receive the message 15 minutes before their appointment and can use the link in the message to check in to the waiting room. Clients will always receive this automated message, regardless of their individual messaging preferences.

Once a client checks in, their appointment will be displayed in purple on the calendar. The service provider will receive a text message letting them know that their client is waiting if the When client checks themself in as "waiting" automated message is enabled in the Settings app under Automated Messages > Check-In Process.

When the client's service provider is ready, the client can be notified by selecting the Notify button.

The Notify button will only display if the When staff member presses "Notify" button automated message is enabled in the Settings app under Automated Messages > Check-In Process.

If you need to notify the client again, select Send Again.

When the appointment is ready to begin, select In Service.

When you select In Service, you can notify the service provider that their client is ready by enabling the When client is checked-in for service automated message in the Settings app under Automated Messages > Check-In Process. You can also disable this automated message for individual service providers.

Adding processing, finishing, and buffer time to services

To enable processing, finishing, and buffer time, open the Settings app and select Calendar & Appointments > Scheduling Options.

Buffer time

Buffer time can be used when a service requires time before or after the appointment. For example, for massage services, you can use buffer time before the appointment to prepare the room and after the appointment to clean the room.

Clients will not be able to book appointments via online booking during the buffer times of existing appointments.

Learn how appointments with buffer time are displayed on the calendar.

Link copied
Processing & finishing time

Processing time is when the client is occupied but the service provider can be booked for other services. It is usually followed by finishing time at the end of the service.

For example, a Partial Highlight service could have the following settings:

Duration: 30 minutes. This is the time it takes to apply the color.

Processing time: 45 minutes. This is the time it takes for the color to develop. The service provider can wait or fit in another appointment. During the processing time, the service provider will be available for appointments via online booking.

Finishing time: 30 minutes. This is the time it takes to wash and blow dry the hair.

Learn how appointments with processing time are displayed on the calendar.

### 22. How Can I Enforce My Cancellation Policy

**Source**: [https://www.mangomint.com/learn/how-can-i-enforce-my-cancellation-policy/](https://www.mangomint.com/learn/how-can-i-enforce-my-cancellation-policy/)

CALENDAR & APPOINTMENTS
APPOINTMENTS
Enforce Your Cancellation Policy

To enforce your cancellation policy and charge your cancellation fee, you can either use a Cancellation Fee service, or you can adjust the service price for the appointment during checkout.

To ensure you can charge your cancellation fee, you can require a credit card in online booking and Express Booking™.

Link copied
Charging a cancellation fee using a Cancellation Fee service

To create a Cancellation Fee service, you must be an Admin user, or you must have the Can manage service settings permission enabled in Staff Member settings.

Open the Services app and add a new category for Cancellations.

Add a service called Cancellation Fee and update the Price.

For example, if you have a flat rate cancellation fee of $25, update the price to $25.

If you charge a percentage of the service price for cancellations (e.g. 50% of the service price), update the price to $0. During checkout, you will adjust the price as needed.

On the calendar, select the appointment and select Cancel/Delete from the "..." menu. Select Late Cancellation or No Show.

Open the Sales app and select New Checkout.

Select the client and add the Cancellation Fee service. Adjust the price of the service, if needed.

Assign a staff member, if needed. This ensures that the staff member will receive any applicable service commission.

Select Go To Payments and complete the checkout as you normally would.

Link copied
Charging a cancellation fee by adjusting the service price for the appointment

On the calendar, select the appointment and select Cancel/Delete from the "..." menu. Select Late Cancellation or No Show.

In the appointment details, select Checkout.

Change the service price to your cancellation fee. Select Go To Payments and complete the checkout as you normally would.

To update your default Express Booking™ settings to require a full payment or partial deposit, open the Settings app and select Calendar & Appointments > Express Booking™.

Enable the Require a payment or deposit to complete booking toggle and select Full payment or Partial deposit. If service tax applies, service tax is only charged when the full payment is required.

Express Booking™

Express Booking™ reduces the time it takes to book appointments by helping you avoid errors and miscommunication when speaking with clients. Express Booking™ is great for businesses with busy front desks as it helps reduce back and forth with clients during the booking process.

With Express Booking™, you can send clients a link via text message where they must enter their information, add a credit card on file (only if required), and accept your cancellation policy in order to complete their booking. If the client does not finish booking their appointment within the time limit, the appointment will be automatically canceled.

To learn more about Express Booking™, watch our on-demand Express Booking™ video.

The articles in this section cover how to set up and use Express Booking™.

### 29. What Happens After An Express Booking Link Is Sent

CALENDAR & APPOINTMENTS
EXPRESS BOOKING™
What happens after an Express Booking™ link is sent?

Once an Express Booking™ link is sent, the appointment is added to the calendar in a Pending status.

If the client completes and submits the required information via the Express Booking™ link, the appointment will be automatically changed from Pending to either Unconfirmed or Confirmed based on your appointment confirmation settings in Apps > Settings > Automated Messages > Appointment Booked.

You can also manually change the appointment to Unconfirmed or Confirmed by selecting Complete while the appointment is still in a Pending status.

If the client fails to submit the required information via the Express Booking™ link within the time limit, the appointment will be automatically canceled. The client will receive a text message letting them know their appointment was automatically canceled.

Once the appointment is canceled, that time slot will be available for booking. If you would like to enforce your cancellation policy, you can follow the steps here.

You have 24 hours to bring the appointment back into the Pending status and resend the Express Booking™ link before the appointment is automatically deleted from the calendar. Any Express Booking™ request that is not completed or manually changed to Unconfirmed or Confirmed will be automatically deleted from the calendar after 24 hours.

Manage and book your rooms, equipment, and other limited resources with the Resources app.

Prevent double-booking your rooms and equipment: Add resource requirements to services to avoid double-booking rooms and equipment.

Limit service availability: Set up services and special events, such as classes, that can only be booked on specific days or during specific times.

Create services that do not require staff members: Set up a service that only requires a resource. This is helpful if your business has equipment, such as a sauna, that clients can use without a staff member being present.

Once your resources are set up, you can view them on the calendar. This allows you to easily see all your resources at a glance, including resources that are scheduled to be in use during each appointment.

To enable the Resources app, go to Apps > Manage apps > Resources and select Enable.

To learn more about resources, watch our on-demand Resources video.

### 31. Adding Resource Requirements To Services

Adding Resource Requirements to Services

After creating a resource, you can add the resource as a requirement for a service.

To add a resource requirement to a service, open the Services app and select the service.

Select the Resources tab. Select Add resource requirement.

Select a resource group and specify which resources from the group can be used to fulfill this resource requirement.

All resources: Any resource from the selected group can be used to fulfill this resource requirement. If you select this option, keep in mind that any resources added to this resource group in the future will also fulfill this resource requirement.

Specific resources: Select which resource(s) can be used to fulfill this resource requirement. If you select two resources, either resource can fulfill this requirement. To require both resources, you will need to separate them into two different resource groups and add them both as separate requirements.

Select Save to add the resource requirement to the service. To add another resource requirement, select Add resource requirement.

Once a resource requirement is added to a service, the system will automatically check during the booking process to see if the resource requirement can be fulfilled.

If the resource is available, it will be automatically assigned.

If the resource is unavailable, a message will be displayed in the appointment details indicating the resource is unavailable. In online booking, clients cannot book the service if the resource is unavailable.

Understanding Resources and Resource Groups

Resources are organized into resource groups. Resource groups allow you to require more than one resource for a service.

Here is an example of how you can set up your resources and resource groups:

If your business offers massages and you have three rooms, there are a couple of different ways you can set up your rooms as resources.

Option 1: This option works well if all of your rooms are the same or can be used for every massage service you offer. With this option, you will not be able to see each individual room as a column on the calendar.

Create a resource group called Rooms. Add a resource to the group called Rooms and give it a capacity of three. Assign the resource to each of your massage services.

Option 2: This option works well if you require different rooms for different massage services, or if you want to see each individual room as a column on the calendar.

Create a resource group called Rooms. Add three resources to the group called Room 1, Room 2, and Room 3. Give each room a capacity of one. Assign the required room to each of your massage services.

Learn how to create resources and add resource requirements to services.

### 36. Using Resources To Manage Service Availability

Setting Up Services with Limited Availability

You can use resources to set up services and events that are only available on certain days or during specific times (holiday events, classes, etc).

This article covers:

Setting up a service with limited availability

Setting up an event or class with a capacity limit

Link copied
Setting up a service with limited availability

If you set up a service that has limited availability:

The limited availability will apply to all staff members who perform the service.

The limited availability will not affect the availability of any other services.

To set up a service with limited availability, create the service in the Services app. In this example, we will set up the service shown below so that it can only be booked on Tuesdays.

Open the Resources app and create a resource group called Day Resources. Add Tuesday as a resource and select No limit of appointments.

Select the Schedule tab. Select Only available on specific days/times and add a repeating schedule on Tuesdays.

Open the Services app and select the service that is only available on Tuesdays.

Select the Resources tab and select Add resource requirement.

Select the Tuesday resource and select Save. The service can now only be booked on Tuesdays.

Learn how you can hide the Tuesday resource from the calendar.

Link copied
Setting up an event or class with a capacity limit

You can set up an event or class that has a capacity limit. For example, you can set up a class and specify that up to 10 clients can attend the class.

To set up an event or class with a capacity limit, create the event or class in the Services app, including adding the duration and price.

When creating the event, enable the Does not require staff members (only resources) toggle.

When this toggle is enabled, the event will not require a staff member in order to be booked. If you pay commission, you will need to add a pay adjustment for the staff member who performs the event.

To ensure the staff member who performs the event isn’t booked for other services during the event time, you can either remove their regular work hours or add a time block during the event time.

To allow the event to be booked online, enable the Available in online booking toggle.

Once the event is created, open the Resources app and create a resource for your event. Select Specific number of appointments and specify the event capacity.

Select the Schedule tab. Select Only available on specific days/times and add the hours when the event is available. These hours must exactly match the event. For example, if the event begins at 3 PM and is 30 minutes, set the hours to 3:00 PM - 3:30 PM.

Open the Services app and select the event.

Select the Resources tab and select Add resource requirement.

Select the resource you created for the event and select Save. The event can now only be booked for the capacity and time you specified.

Learn how you can hide the event resource from the calendar.

You can use resources to create a service that doesn't require a staff member. This is helpful if your business has equipment, such as a sauna, that clients can use themselves without a staff member needing to be present.

To create a service that doesn't require a staff member, open the Services app and create a new service.

In the service details, select Additional options and enable the Does not require staff members (only resources) toggle.

Once you’ve created the service, create a resource and add it as a requirement to the service. The service can now be booked without selecting a staff member.

To view resource-only appointments on the calendar, select the resource from the calendar filters. Learn more about viewing resources on the calendar.

Setting Up Waitlist Automated Messages

To set up and customize waitlist automated messages, open the Settings app and select Automated Messages > Waitlist Entries.

Link copied
Client notifications

Clients can be notified when they are added to the waitlist. Email notifications will include the details of the waitlist entry, including dates, times, and services requested.

Link copied
Staff member notifications

Staff members (e.g. front desk or managers) can be notified via email when clients add themselves to the waitlist in online booking. Staff members can also be notified when openings become available.

Clients are not automatically notified when an opening becomes available. Instead, staff members can be automatically notified, which allows them to select which clients they want to book. This is helpful if the same opening is available for more than one client.

Cancellations & Rescheduling

Cancellation Policy
Cancel & Reschedule
Late Cancellations

To adjust your cancellation and rescheduling settings, open the Settings app and select Calendar & Appointments > Cancel & Reschedule.

Link copied
Cancellation Policy

A cancellation policy can help protect you if clients have late cancellations, and it can also help prevent no-shows.

Once you add your cancellation policy, it will be included in various automated emails and text messages, and other locations such as online booking.

For a guide on how to create your cancellation policy, visit our blog.

Link copied
Cancel & Reschedule

Allow clients to cancel and reschedule their own appointments through the client portal.

You can allow self-cancellations and self-rescheduling up to a certain number of hours before the appointment start time. After that time, clients will be prompted to call the business instead.

If self-cancellations or self-rescheduling are allowed, clients can cancel or reschedule within 15 minutes of booking online. For example, if you allow self-cancellations or self-rescheduling up to 24 hours before the appointment, clients can cancel or reschedule within 15 minutes of booking online, even if it's within 24 hours of the appointment.

Link copied
Late Cancellations

Specify the time after which the cancellation type will default to Late Cancellation when staff members cancel appointments on the calendar. The cancellation type will only default to Late Cancellation if it has been at least 15 minutes since the appointment was booked.

If a client cancels an appointment through the client portal, it is considered a Normal Cancellation, regardless of the time selected for the Late Cancellations setting. If you need to change a Normal Cancellation to a Late Cancellation, select Change Cancellation Type from the "..." menu.

Adding your Mangomint calendar to your Google calendar

This article covers how to link your Mangomint calendar to your Apple or Google calendar using an iCal link. The iCal link is only available per staff member—not as a company calendar—and it will only sync appointments, not time blocks.

Important: 

The iCal link only syncs information from Mangomint to Apple/Google—it does not sync changes made in Apple/Google to Mangomint. Changes made in Mangomint can take up to several hours to update on your other calendars.

Link copied

Appointment Increments

Select the time increments at which appointments can be booked and service durations set.

Link copied
Buffer Time

When enabled, additional buffer time can be added before or after services. This is useful for preparation or cleanup time, and it allows you to block the service provider for a longer period of time without changing the duration of the service itself. Learn more about buffer time.

Link copied
Processing & Finishing Time

When enabled, processing and finishing time can be added to services. This is useful in hair salons for color processing. During processing time, the client is occupied, but the service provider can be booked for other services. Processing time is usually followed by finishing time at the end of the service. Learn more about processing and finishing time.

Group Appointments

When enabled, multiple clients can be booked together. Clients will have separate appointments and receive individual notifications. Learn more about group booking.
