Webhooks Integration
Note: 

Webhooks is an advanced integration that is available as an add-on with the Standard and Unlimited plans for $50/month. Any third-party applications you use to create and manage your webhooks may also have a separate fee.

Our Webhooks integration allows you to send event data from Mangomint to other third-party applications.

Set up flexible integrations between Mangomint and other applications to notify external systems when key events occur in Mangomint, such as:

Appointment booked, updated, or canceled

Sale completed

Form submitted

To get started with webhooks, contact chat support. We can help you set up custom webhooks based on the endpoint URLs you provide.

Adding SKUs to Mangomint

Our Shopify integration allows you to sync product inventory seamlessly between Mangomint and your Shopify online store.

Mangomint will be the main system (inventory changes made in Mangomint will be synced to Shopify, including manual inventory changes and product sales).

When a product is sold in Mangomint, the inventory level from Mangomint will sync to Shopify so that both systems match.

Manual inventory changes made in Shopify will not be synced to Mangomint.

Shopify orders will not be added as sales in Mangomint. However, when a Shopify order is received, the inventory in Mangomint will be reduced. An inventory change will be added to Mangomint that includes the Shopify order number as a reference.

Our Shopify integration syncs inventory levels only. Any other product updates (e.g. price updates) must be made in both Mangomint and Shopify.

Setting up and using the Shopify integration

To set up and use the Shopify integration, make sure any product you want to sync exists in both Mangomint and Shopify with the same SKU.

Once identical SKUs have been added to both systems, reach out to your Onboarding Manager or chat support to complete the integration.

Once the integration is complete, you can add a new product at any time by adding the SKU to Shopify first, then Mangomint. This ensures that once there is a sale in Mangomint for the product, the inventory level from Mangomint can immediately sync to Shopify.

Adding SKUs to Shopify

To add SKUs to your products in Shopify, go to the Products screen and select a product.

Enter the SKU and select Save.

Adding SKUs to Mangomint

Enter the SKU and select Save Changes.
