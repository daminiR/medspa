Using Multiple Phone Numbers

This article covers how to manage your messages when using multiple phone numbers.

If you have multiple locations, you can use multiple phone numbers. Each location can have its own phone number, or you can assign multiple locations to the same number.

When viewing a conversation, you can see the phone number and assigned location(s) being used.

Admin users can view conversations for all locations. Non-Admin users (Normal users) can only view conversations for the locations enabled for them in Apps > Staff Members > Locations.

When viewing conversations for all locations in the Messages app, the same client may appear multiple times in the conversation list. This is because the client has conversations with multiple locations that are assigned different phone numbers.

In the client details, you can view a client’s conversations across locations. You can select All Locations to see if the client has received flow text messages from your marketing phone number.

PHONE NUMBERS
Adding and Changing Phone Numbers

To manage your phone numbers, open the Settings app and select Business Setup > Phone Numbers.

Link copied
Additional phone numbers

By default, your account includes one phone number for automated text messages, (PLACEHOLDER SEE ERROR LOG), and non-marketing flow text messages. This phone number is used for all your locations.

If you have multiple locations, you can add multiple phone numbers. This allows each location to have its own number. You can also assign multiple locations to the same number.

Using multiple phone numbers can be helpful if you have:

Locations in different area codes

Staff members who should only have access to conversations for specific locations. By assigning locations to different phone numbers, staff members will only have access to conversations for the locations enabled for them in Apps > Staff Members > Locations.

Link copied
Adding a phone number

When adding a phone number, you can:

Add one phone number for each physical and virtual location

Add one marketing phone number for all your locations

To add a phone number, open the Settings app and select Business Setup > Phone Numbers.

Select Add a phone number.

Specify which type of phone number to add and complete the required steps to add the number.

Two-Way Texting (Local): This phone number will be used for automated text messages, (PLACEHOLDER SEE ERROR LOG), and non-marketing flow text messages.

Marketing (Toll-Free): This phone number will be used for marketing flow text messages. This ensures that if clients unsubscribe from a marketing flow text, they won’t be unsubscribed from appointment-related texts such as appointment reminders.

If you are adding a local number, you will be able to select a number from the available options and assign it to your locations.

If you are adding a toll-free number, you will need to register for the number using your business information. Make sure you complete the registration form as accurately as possible.

Note: 

After registering for a toll-free number, there will be an approval process of 1-5 business days before you can start using the number.

Learn more about managing your messages when using multiple phone numbers.

Changing a phone number

If you need to change a phone number, open the Settings app and select Business Setup > Phone Numbers.

Select Change number from the "..." menu. You will be able to select a number from the available options.

Important: 

If you change a phone number, the previous number will stop working immediately. You will not be able to restore the previous number.

When adding a location, you can choose between a physical or virtual location.
