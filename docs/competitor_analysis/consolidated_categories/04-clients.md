Collecting Waivers Using WaiverForever

After creating a waiver in WaiverForever, you can add the waiver link to your automated messages to collect waivers from your clients.

In WaiverForever, go to the Waiver Templates screen and select the waiver to add to your automated messages.

Copy the link to the waiver.

In Mangomint, open the Settings app and select Automated Messages.

Select the gear icon next to the message to update and select Customize.

Paste the link to the waiver and save your changes. The waiver will now be included in your automated messages.

Once clients fill out the waiver, the PDF is automatically added to their client timeline.

Important: 

When clients complete a waiver, it’s important that they use the same email address/phone number that’s on file in Mangomint to successfully sync the completed waiver to their client profile.

CLIENT PORTAL
Client Portal

The client portal allows clients to manage their appointments, memberships, and packages online.

Manage appointments: Clients can book new appointments and view, reschedule, or cancel upcoming appointments.

Manage memberships & packages: Clients can view their membership & package details, update their membership payment method, and cancel their membership.

You can also customize the client portal with your brand color, company logo, and a custom cover image.

Clients can access the client portal from their automated messages, and you can also add a link to the client portal to your flow messages using the Client Profile Link merge tag. Clients do not need a username or password to access the client portal.

The Call, Email, and Website buttons will display in the client portal once the following business information has been entered:

Go to Apps > Settings > Business Setup > Locations and enter a Contact phone and Contact email.

Go to Apps > Settings > Business Setup > Business Details and enter a Website address.

The articles in this section cover how to use the client portal, including managing appointments and memberships.

Pause and Resume a Client’s Membership

Pausing memberships gives clients more flexibility with managing their membership payments, and it also allows clients to change their membership billing date. When a paused membership resumes, the membership billing date may change, depending on the date the membership resumes.

When a membership is paused:

The client will not be charged until the membership resumes.

The client will be able to redeem any remaining membership services until the services expire.

The client will not be able to redeem any product or service discounts included in their membership, or any offers limited to clients with active memberships.

Link copied
Pausing memberships

To pause a client's membership, open the client's membership details.

Select Pause from the "..." menu and specify the duration of the pause.

Pause indefinitely: Select this option to pause the membership indefinitely. It will remain paused until it is resumed by a staff member.

Pause until a specific date: Select this option to pause the membership and automatically resume it on a specific date. This date will become the new membership billing date.

Once the membership is paused, the client will receive an email confirmation. This email will only be sent if the membership was active when it was paused.

Link copied
Resuming memberships

To resume a client’s paused membership, open the client's membership details.

Select Resume/Modify Pause from the "..." menu and specify when to resume the membership.

Resume now: Select this option to resume the membership and charge the client immediately.

Pause indefinitely: If the membership is paused until a specific date, you can select this option to pause the membership indefinitely instead.

Pause until a specific date: If the membership is paused until a specific date, you can change the date as needed. If the membership is paused indefinitely, you can select this option to automatically resume the membership on a specific date instead.

Starting a membership that requires an agreement

To start a new membership that requires a membership agreement, open the Memberships app and select New Membership.

Select the client and the membership they’d like to purchase, and specify when to start the membership.

Select Now to charge the client immediately. If the payment is successful, the membership will become active.

Select Now > Advanced Options > First billing date is after start date if you would like the client’s membership to become active immediately, but you don’t want to charge the client until a later date. This is helpful if you are importing the client's membership from a previous system. With this option, all product and service discounts in the membership will become active; however, any services included in the membership will not be redeemable until the first payment.

Select In the future to schedule the membership to start on a future date. The client will not be charged until the selected date. No membership services or discounts will be redeemable until the selected date.

If applicable, select a billing location for the membership. Learn more about membership billing locations.

Specify whether to request signature and payment via email or text and select Start Membership. The client will receive an email or text with a link to sign the membership agreement and enter their credit card details for automatic billing.

The membership status will be changed to Waiting on signature. The membership will not become active until the client has signed the agreement, entered their credit card details, and completed the payment.

The membership status will be changed to Past Due if the client does not complete this step within 24 hours.

After a successful payment, the client will receive an email confirmation that includes the details of their membership and a link to download their signed agreement.

Select Automatic to automatically charge a credit card saved in the client's profile when the membership renews. You will need to sign up for payment processing to use this option.

Use a card on file: Select this option to use an existing card on file or to enter a new card.

Request credit card from client (via email): Select this option to send the client an email with a link to enter their credit card details.

The membership status will be changed to Credit card needed. The membership will not become active until the client has entered their credit card details and the payment is successful.

The membership status will be changed to Past Due if the client does not complete this step within 24 hours. Learn how you can resend the email request to the client if needed.

Select Manual to allow the client to pay manually every time the membership renews. For example, the client may want to pay in person with cash. When the client's membership payment is due, a sale for the membership will be created automatically. You must manually collect the payment and close the sale to keep the membership active.

After a successful payment, the client will receive an email confirmation that includes the details of their membership.

Automated messages for memberships

You can customize your automated messages for memberships by opening the Settings app and selecting Automated Messages > Memberships. Automated messages are sent to clients for new memberships, renewal reminders, successful renewals, and canceled memberships.

You can also use automated flows to send automated messages for memberships. By using automated flows, you can send different messages to clients based on their specific membership plan.

Membership started: Use this flow trigger to send messages to clients when their membership begins.

Membership canceled: Use this flow trigger to send messages to clients when their membership is canceled.

Before membership credits expire: Use this flow trigger to send messages to clients when their membership services are about to expire.

### 10. Managing Appointments From The Client Portal

CLIENT PORTAL
Managing Appointments from the Client Portal

This article covers how to reschedule and cancel appointments from the client portal.

Clients can access the client portal from their automated messages, and you can also add a link to the client portal to your flow messages using the Client Profile Link merge tag. Clients do not need a username or password to access the client portal.

Link copied
Rescheduling appointments from the client portal

To allow clients to reschedule their own appointments from the client portal, open the Settings app and go to Calendar & Appointments > Cancel & Reschedule > Allow self-rescheduling.

Once self-rescheduling is enabled, clients can select Reschedule in the client portal to reschedule an appointment.

When rescheduling, clients can select a new date and time. Clients will only see availability for the same staff member.

Appointments cannot be rescheduled if:

The appointment duration was manually changed and is different from the default service duration.

The appointment has services that are not available in online booking.

The appointment has overlapping services. However, overlapping buffer time does allow the appointment to be rescheduled.

The appointment is part of a group. However, the primary contact for the group can self-reschedule the entire group.

You can customize your automated messages for rescheduled appointments by opening the Settings app and selecting Automated Messages > Appointment Rescheduled.

These messages will only be sent when clients reschedule from the client portal, not when staff members reschedule from the calendar.

Link copied
Canceling appointments from the client portal

To allow clients to cancel their own appointments from the client portal, open the Settings app and go to Calendar & Appointments > Cancel & Reschedule > Allow self-cancellations.

Once self-cancellations are enabled, clients can select Cancel in the client portal to cancel an appointment.

You can customize your automated messages for canceled appointments by opening the Settings app and selecting Automated Messages > Appointment Canceled.

You can also use an automated flow to re-engage clients if their appointment is canceled and encourage them to rebook. The Appointment cancellation follow up pre-built flow and Appointment canceled trigger are available for you to use.

Clients can use their account balance as a payment method to pay for any sales, including any services or products.

To use a client’s account balance as a payment method, begin the checkout as you normally would.

If the client has an account balance, their account balance will be shown on the Payments screen.

If the client has an available account balance to use, select Charge or the Account Balance payment button.

If the client does not have an available account balance to use, you can still select the Account Balance payment button. This will create a negative account balance that the client can pay later by making a deposit into their account balance.

Select Confirm to complete the account balance payment.

If the sale has a remaining balance, you can select a different payment method to complete the sale. You can also select the Account Balance payment button again to create a negative account balance that the client can pay later.

The next time the client begins a checkout, you will be able to see that they have a negative account balance they need to pay. Clients can make a deposit into their account balance to pay their outstanding balance.

Online Booking from the Client’s Perspective

With online booking, clients can book appointments online through your website or any other platform where your booking link is shared.

Clients do not need to log in or create an account to use online booking. This ensures an easy and convenient booking experience for your clients.

To learn more about online booking for your clients, watch our on-demand Online Booking For Your Clients video.

Online booking from the client’s perspective

The video below shows an example of a client booking an appointment through online booking. In this example, the online booking link was added to the business’s website.

In the video, the client:

Has the option to buy a gift card online

Customizes the selected service using service customizations

Has the option to add multiple services to their appointment

Has the option to join the waitlist if they don’t find a time that works for them

Agrees to your cancellation policy. Clients are required to agree to your cancellation policy to book an appointment through online booking.

Has the option to upload up to 3 reference or inspiration photos after successfully booking their appointment

Has the ability to complete the required form after successfully booking their appointment. Clients can also complete their forms in person.

In this example, the client was not required to enter their credit card information to book the service. However, you can require clients to enter their credit card information to book specific services. Having a card on file for a client is helpful if you need to enforce your cancellation policy and charge the client any no-show or cancellation fees.

After a successful booking, the client will receive an automated message with their appointment details. You can also set up internal notifications and flows for online bookings.

Learn more about setting up online booking and adjusting online booking preferences. You can also use direct booking links for individual staff members, services, and service categories.

For example, you can set up a flow that automatically adds $20 to the client's account balance as a loyalty reward when the client completes at least 5 appointments.

When building your flow, select Advanced Options > Add to account balance to specify the amount to add to the client's account balance. When viewing the client's account balance history, the name of the flow will be included for reference.

Cancel a Client’s Membership

To cancel a client's membership, open the client's membership details.

Select Cancel from the "..." menu and select a cancellation date.

Immediately: Select this option to cancel the client’s membership immediately. This is helpful if the client requested a refund and their membership benefits need to be removed immediately.

End of current period: Select this option for the membership to remain active until the end of the current period. This is helpful if the client doesn’t want to renew the membership, but the membership should remain active for the remainder of the current period.

On a custom date: Select this option to specify the date when the client's membership should be canceled automatically. This is helpful for minimum notice periods, minimum contracts, etc.

Upon cancellation, any remaining services that have not expired will still be available for the client to use. If the client requested a refund for the current billing cycle, you will need to manually adjust the quantities of their remaining services to remove the refunded items.

When a membership for a client is canceled, the client will receive an automated email message with the cancellation details. You can customize this automated message by opening the Settings app and selecting Automated Messages > Memberships.

You can also use an automated flow to send messages to clients when their membership is canceled. The Membership cancellation follow up pre-built flow and Membership canceled trigger are available for you to use.

CREATING & REQUESTING FORMS
Sending Forms to Clients

Once a client form template is enabled, the form will be included in automated messages for clients to complete. Once a client submits a form, the form will not be included in future automated messages.

By default, client forms are not included in automated text messages. To change this, open the Settings app. Select Automated Messages and enable the Include form requests toggle for each automated text message.

In addition to completing forms through their automated messages, clients can also complete their forms from the confirmation screen after booking online or completing an Express Booking™.

You can also locate client forms in the appointment details and select Send Request to send the client a text message with a link to fill out the form.

If a client arrives for their appointment but hasn't submitted their forms, they can fill out the forms in person.

Link copied
Reminding clients to fill out their forms

You can use an automated flow to check if a client's upcoming appointment has incomplete forms.

If the appointment has incomplete forms, you can send a message to the client with a link that allows them to complete all their forms before their appointment.

For email marketing ideas and examples, including templates you can use, visit our blog.

Create and send an email campaign

To create an email campaign, open the Campaigns app and select New Campaign.

Link copied
Settings

In the Settings tab of the email builder, update the email settings, including the subject line and recipient list.

Select Advanced Options to set the Preview text if needed. This text is displayed directly below the subject line in the recipient’s inbox, as shown below.

In the Send campaign to section, specify the recipient list for the email. This section allows you to select from all clients, regardless of client ownership or your permissions.

All clients: Select this option to send the email to every client who is eligible for email campaigns.

Only certain clients based on filters: Select this option to only send the email to clients who match specific filters.

Once you specify the recipient list, you can preview the clients who will receive the email. The email will only be sent to clients who match the criteria now, not clients who will match the criteria at the time the email is sent.

Link copied
Content

In the Content tab of the email builder, build the email by selecting a template or starting from scratch. To learn more about how you can build your email, watch our on-demand Email Builder Tips & Tricks video.

When building your email:

Update any social media links with your unique social media links.

Merge tags can be used to personalize the email for each recipient. For example, when the email is sent, the First Name merge tag is replaced with the client’s first name, and the Business Address merge tag is replaced with your address from Apps > Settings > Business Setup > Locations. To add a merge tag, select Merge tags as shown below. You can either highlight existing text to replace with a merge tag, or insert the merge tag into an empty space as shown below.

Special links can be used to add an unsubscribe link. Unsubscribe links are required to send an email campaign. To add an unsubscribe link, select Special links > Frequently used > Unsubscribe as shown below.

After building an email, you can duplicate the email if needed. This allows you to easily send similar emails without having to recreate the same email every time.

Link copied
Review & Send

In the Review & Send tab of the email builder, you can send the email immediately or schedule it to be sent at a later date and time.

By default, email campaigns are sent from the mangomint-email.com domain. Learn how you can send emails from a custom email address.

To send or schedule an email:

You must be an Admin user, or you must have the Can send campaigns permission enabled in Staff Member settings.

You will need a Contact email address in Apps > Settings > Business Setup > Locations. This email address will be used as the reply-to address.

You will need marketing credits. Each client on the recipient list requires 1 marketing credit. For example, you can send an email to 200 clients for 200 credits. If you are the billing user for your account, you can buy credits from the Review & Send tab and your Subscription page.

After an email is sent, you can view the email's performance, such as how many emails were delivered, opened, etc.

CLIENT ACCOUNT BALANCES
Client Account Balances

Clients can have an account balance that can be used as a payment method during checkout. Clients can use their account balance to pay for any sales, including any services or products.

Client account balances also provide more flexibility for transactions and memberships.

More refund and credit options: Refund or reverse payments directly to a client’s account balance. You can also manually add (i.e. credit) a specific amount to a client's account balance as a reward, gift, etc.

Move deposits between appointments: Refund a deposit directly to a client’s account balance to use for another appointment or sale.

Account balance memberships: Set up account balance memberships that allow clients to add money to their account balance every billing period to use for any sales, including any services or products.

To enable client account balances, open the Settings app and go to Business Setup > Advanced Settings > Client Account Balances.

The articles in this section cover client account balances, including adjusting account balances, using account balances during checkout, and more.

Open the Packages app or select the Packages tab in the client details.

Client Ownership

You can use the client ownership settings if your business has booth renters and you'd like to keep client lists separate.

Link copied
Enable client ownership

When client ownership is enabled, a staff member can be assigned as the “owner” of a client. This allows staff members to only have access to their own clients. All other staff members’ clients will be hidden.

When the client ownership setting is first enabled, all existing clients will remain as is (no owner will be assigned).

If a staff member owns a client, that client can still book with another staff member. Duplicate client records can be created to allow assigning a different owner to each client record.

Learn more about assigning owners to clients via the client details.

Link copied
Online booking ownership assignment

When enabled, the selected service provider will be assigned as the owner of new clients who book through online booking. This only applies to newly created clients.

Link copied
Work schedule overlap

For staff members who work at more than one location, allow their work schedules to overlap across multiple locations.

Link copied
Custom email address

Set up a custom email address for email campaigns and flow emails. You will need to connect your domain with Mangomint using custom DNS records.

Client account balances

Enable this toggle to allow clients to have an account balance that can be used as a payment method and refund option. Learn more about client account balances.
