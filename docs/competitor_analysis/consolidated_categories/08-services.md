Services sold through Groupon or other promotional websites have usually already been paid for by the client. This article covers how to track and redeem these services in Mangomint.

Create a Groupon service

To create a Groupon service, open the Services app and add a new Groupon service category with all the services in your Groupon promotion.

When creating each service, add the Groupon pricing and the duration of the service.

Under Additional options, you can add a pre-commission deduction to deduct any Groupon fees before calculating commission for your staff members.

After creating each Groupon service, assign the services to staff members.

Create a Groupon payment button

To track your Groupon sales, open the Settings app and go to Payments & Checkout > Advanced Settings > Custom Payment Methods to add a Groupon payment button.

Check out a Groupon service

To check out a Groupon service, start the checkout as you normally would. On the Payments screen, ask the client if they would like to leave a tip.

If the client does not want to tip, use the Groupon payment button to close the sale.

If the client does want to tip, select the tip percentage or enter a custom tip amount.

Enter the Groupon service amount (minus the tip) as the Amount to charge and select the Groupon payment button.

Add any reference notes, if needed. Select Add to complete the Groupon payment.

Once the Groupon payment is complete, select another payment method for the remaining balance (tip amount) to complete the sale.

When you run payroll for your staff members, their commission should be based on the dollar amount paid by the client minus any pre-commission deductions.

### 3. How Do I Set Up Couples Services

SERVICES
Creating a Couples Service

To create a couples service, such as a couples massage, enter the service details and enable the Requires two staff members toggle under Additional options. This will require two staff members to be selected to book the service.

When booking the couples service, the service will be booked under the booking client’s name. If the service requires a client form, any submitted forms will only be added to the booking client’s profile.

Appointments for couples services can be easily updated on the calendar if needed. For example, if you need to update the appointment time or change a service provider, simply drag and drop the appointment accordingly.

Staff commission and tips for couples services

For couples services, each staff member receives commission for half of the service price. For example, if Katie and Sara perform a couples massage for $100, they will each receive commission for half of the service price ($50).

If Katie receives 30% commission, she will receive $15 (30% of $50).

If Sara receives 20% commission, she will receive $10 (20% of $50).

If a client leaves a tip for a couples service, it will be split evenly between both staff members unless a custom split is used.

If certain staff members do not require a credit card, you can disable the credit card requirement for each staff member in the Staff Members app.

Link copied
Require payment at the time of booking

When enabled, clients will be required to enter their credit card information and pay for the service at the time of booking. You can select either Full payment or Partial deposit.

Create Service Customizations
IN THIS ARTICLE
Create a service customization
Add the same service customization to multiple services
Delete a service customization

To create and manage service customizations, you must be an Admin user, or you must have the Can manage services permission enabled in Staff Member settings.

Once you create a service customization for one service, that same customization can be linked to your other services.

Link copied
Create a service customization

To create a service customization, open the Services app. Select the service and select the Customizations tab.

Select Create Option Group (if you already set up a service customization for another service, select Add Option Group > Create New Option Group). Service customizations are organized into option groups. For example, you can create an option group called Aromatherapy and add Lavender, Eucalyptus, and Orange Blossom as options.

The following settings are available for each option group:

Link copied
Prompt for clients

Enter a Prompt for clients to prompt clients to select an option in online booking.

Link copied
Group name

Enter a Group name that will be displayed when booking the service. This name will not be visible to clients.

Link copied
Available options

Add the available options for the option group.

The following settings are available for each option:

Option name: The option name is limited to 20 characters. To use more than 20 characters, or to use a different option name in online booking, update the Show in online booking as name.

This option changes the service duration: Enable this toggle if this option changes the service duration. The time increments will be the same increments used on the calendar (e.g. 5 or 15 minutes).

This option changes the service price: Enable this toggle if this option changes the service price. You can either increase or decrease the price by the amount you specify.

This option adds a resource requirement: Enable this toggle if this option adds a resource requirement. Clients will only see times in online booking when this resource is available. The resource will be booked for the entire duration of the service.

If you add a resource requirement from the same resource group as the base service, the system will override & replace the resource requirement for the base service when a client selects this option. To require both resources, separate them into two different resource groups.

Exclude some staff members: Enable this toggle to specify any staff members excluded from performing this option.

This option has a commission deduction: Enable this toggle if this option adds a pre or post-commission deduction. This commission deduction will be in addition to any commission deductions for the base service. Learn more about how commission is calculated with service customizations.

Link copied
Is this option group required or optional?

Specify whether making a selection is required or optional. If making a selection is required, you can specify if more than one option can be selected and set a minimum and maximum number of selections.

Link copied
Advanced Options

Show option prices in online booking: Enable this toggle to show the price changes (e.g. +$20) next to each option in online booking.

Show as base prices in online booking: Enable this toggle if this option group should display as the base price in online booking. Learn more about this setting.

Show duration changes in online booking: Enable this toggle to show the duration changes (e.g. +15min) next to each option in online booking.

Internal only: Enable this toggle to hide this option group from online booking and exclude it from client emails and receipts. This setting is helpful if staff members need to add special requests or appointment requirements that should not be visible to the client.

Show icon on calendar when selected: Enable this toggle to show an appointment icon on the calendar when an option from this group is selected.

Once you've created the service customization, you can customize the service for an appointment.

Link copied
Add the same service customization to multiple services

To add the same service customization to multiple services, select Add Option Group and select the existing service customization.

Important: 

Any changes made to the service customization will affect all services that use this customization.

Link copied
Delete a service customization

To delete a service customization, the service customization must be removed from all services.

Once the service customization is removed from all services, select Add Option Group > Delete.

Service Customizations

With service customizations, you can offer flexible customizations and add-ons for your services to create personalized client experiences.

If your business offers haircuts, you can collect information about your clients’ hair length and hair texture at the time of booking to customize their experience.

If your business offers massages, you can give clients the option to select add-ons such as massage oils or hot stones for an additional price.

Service customizations are highly flexible. You can set up customizations that:

Are required or optional

Increase or decrease the service price and/or duration

Add a resource requirement to the service

To enable service customizations, go to Apps > Manage apps > Service Customizations and select Enable.

To learn more about service customizations, the following on-demand videos are available:

If applicable, select processing, finishing, and buffer times for the service. The processing and finishing times can later be customized for individual staff members.

Show Base Prices for Service Customizations

When creating or editing service customizations, you can specify whether an option group should display as the base price in online booking.

An example of the base price setting is shown below. In this example, hair length is used to determine the base price for a Signature Haircut service.

Link copied
Using the base price setting

To use the base price setting, open the Services app and select the service. Select the Customizations tab.

Select Advanced Options for the option group.

Enable the Show as base prices in online booking toggle to display a base price next to each option in online booking. The base price combines the price of the option with the price of the service.

The base price setting can only be enabled if the option group requires at least 1 and at most 1 selection, and it only applies to the first option group shown in online booking. If needed, you can reorder option groups by selecting Reorder.
