If a client's membership is outdated, select Show details or upgrade to switch the client's membership to the current version of the membership plan. If you switch the membership, product and service discount changes will take effect immediately, while changes to price or services will take effect with the next billing cycle.

To find all client memberships that use a different version, open the Memberships app and select Options.

Once you’ve added a membership agreement to your membership plan, clients will be required to sign the agreement before they can start a new membership in person and online.

This article covers how to:

Sign membership agreements

Access signed membership agreements

Bypass membership agreements

Link copied
Signing membership agreements

When a client starts a new membership in person that requires an agreement, you can send the client an email with a link to sign the agreement and enter their credit card details for automatic billing.

The membership status will be changed to Waiting on signature. The membership will not become active until the client has signed the agreement, entered their credit card details, and completed the payment.

The membership status will be changed to Past Due if the client does not complete this step within 24 hours. Learn how you can resend the email request to the client if needed.

After a successful payment, the client will receive an email confirmation that includes the details of their membership and a link to download their signed agreement.

When a client starts a new membership online that requires an agreement, they will need to sign the agreement before they can start the membership. After a successful payment, the client will receive an email confirmation that includes the details of their membership and a link to download their signed agreement.

Link copied
Accessing signed membership agreements

To view, print, or download a client’s signed membership agreement, open the client's membership details and select the Agreement tab.

Select Print to print the signed agreement. In the print dialog box, your web browser may also include the option to save the document as a PDF.

Link copied
Bypassing membership agreements

You can enable the Can bypass membership agreements permission for specific staff members. This allows staff, such as business owners or managers, to bypass membership agreements as needed when starting new memberships in person.

When an agreement is bypassed, clients can start their membership immediately without having to sign, which you may choose to allow for repeat clients whom you trust or clients who otherwise don’t need to sign the agreement.

To bypass a membership agreement, enable the Skip signature for membership agreement toggle when starting the membership. Once the agreement is bypassed, you can start the membership as you normally would. The Agreement tab in the client's membership details will show the staff member who bypassed the agreement.

Create a Service-Based Membership Plan

This article covers how to create a service-based membership plan. To create an account balance membership plan, follow these steps.

To view membership plan ideas, the following resources from the Mangomint blog are available:

Create a profitable spa membership

Salon and spa membership ideas

Create a med spa membership

To create membership plans, you must be an Admin user, or you must have the Can manage membership plans permission enabled in Staff Member settings.

Link copied
Create a service-based membership plan

To create a service-based membership plan, open the Memberships app and select Manage plans.

Select Create Membership Plan and enter a name for the membership. This name will be displayed in emails, receipts, and the client portal.

Select Services and select Create.

Link copied
Details tab

In the Details tab, update the billing and expiration details for the membership.

Memberships can be billed in day, week, or month intervals. For example, use 1 Month for monthly memberships, and 12 Months for annual memberships. The minimum billing interval is every 7 days.

You can specify the time after which unredeemed services will expire. You can also manually adjust the quantity of remaining services on a client's membership, even if unredeemed services have expired. This can be helpful if a client only missed their visit by a few days and would still like to use their membership services.

If you choose to charge service tax, clients will be charged service tax for the membership services at the time the membership is billed.

Link copied
Services tab

In the Services tab, select Add service group to add services to the membership.

Services are organized into service groups. For example, if a service group contains Signature Facial, Signature Mani, and Signature Pedi and you select One service, the client can redeem one of those three services per billing cycle.

If you set up two service groups as shown below, the client can redeem a Signature Facial and a Signature Mani per billing cycle.

You can also allow a service to be redeemed multiple times per billing cycle. In the example below, the client can redeem two Express Facials a month.

You can specify whether to include service customizations in each service group. When the membership is applied at checkout, you can include service customizations up to the amount you specify.

Link copied
Discounts tab

In the Discounts tab, specify any product or additional service discounts included in the membership. These discounts will be automatically applied to all products and services purchased by clients with active memberships. You can manually remove these discounts during checkout if they do not apply to certain products or services.

If you’d like to choose which products or services are eligible for a discount, you can create an offer instead and limit it to clients with this membership.

Agreement tab

In the Agreement tab, specify whether clients should be required to sign an agreement when starting the membership in person and online. Signed agreements can help protect your business and set clear expectations for clients.

When creating your agreement, things to keep in mind include:

If you make changes to the agreement later, agreements that have already been signed will not be affected.

The current membership price and billing frequency will be automatically included in the agreement. If you change your membership price or billing frequency, agreements that have already been signed will not be affected.

If you switch a client’s membership to the current version of the plan, or if you change the price/discount on a client’s membership, the client’s signed agreement will not be affected.

Client Membership Statuses

This article covers the different client membership statuses displayed in the Memberships app.

Membership status

	

Description




Active

	

The membership is active, and payments have been successful. Membership services and discounts are redeemable.




Scheduled

	

The membership is scheduled to start on a future date. Membership services and discounts are not redeemable until the scheduled start date.




Waiting on signature

	

The client needs to sign the membership agreement sent to them via email or text. The membership will not become active until the client has signed the agreement, entered their credit card details, and completed the payment. If the client does not sign within 24 hours, the membership status will be changed to Past Due.




Credit card needed

	

The client needs to enter their credit card details via the request sent to them. Learn how to resend the request if needed. The membership will not become active until the client has entered their credit card details and completed the payment. If the client does not enter their credit card details within 24 hours, the membership status will be changed to Past Due.




Manual Payment Due

	

The manual payment for the membership is due. You will need to manually collect the payment and close the sale to keep the membership active.




Past Due

	

The client did not sign the membership agreement or enter their credit card details, or the automatic payment for the membership failed. The system will make four more charge attempts within seven days. If no payments are successful, the membership status will be changed to Unpaid.




Unpaid

	

The membership has had four unsuccessful payment attempts in seven days.




Paused

	

The membership is paused, and the client will not be charged until the membership resumes. When the membership is paused, remaining membership services are redeemable, while membership discounts are not redeemable.




Canceled

	

The membership is canceled, and no future charges will occur. Any remaining membership services will still be available to use. Learn how you can manually adjust the quantities of remaining services on a client’s membership.

### 8. How Do I Transfer Memberships From My Old Booking System

CLIENT MEMBERSHIPS
Transferring Memberships from a Previous Booking System

To transfer your memberships from a previous booking system into Mangomint, you will need to create your membership plans in Mangomint and create each client membership separately.

When creating each client membership, if the client already paid for their membership through your previous booking system, you can enable the First billing date is after start date toggle under Advanced Options. This allows the client's membership to become active immediately without charging the client until the selected date.

If the client's membership had a specific number of remaining services in your previous booking system, you will need to adjust the number of remaining services after creating the client's membership.

Once your memberships are transferred into Mangomint, make sure you cancel the memberships in your previous booking system.

### 11. Create An Account Balance Membership Plan

Create an Account Balance Membership Plan

This article covers how to create an account balance membership plan. To create a service-based membership plan, follow these steps.

Account balance memberships allow clients to add money to their client account balance every billing period instead of receiving redeemable membership services.

Clients can use the money in their account balance to pay for any sales, including any services or products.

Client account balances never expire and can be used at any of your locations, giving clients the flexibility to use their account balance at their convenience.

To learn more about how you can set up and use account balance memberships, visit our blog.

To create membership plans, you must be an Admin user, or you must have the Can manage membership plans permission enabled in Staff Member settings.

Create an account balance membership plan

To create an account balance membership plan, client account balances must be enabled by opening the Settings app and going to Business Setup > Advanced Settings > Client Account Balances.

To create an account balance membership plan, open the Memberships app and select Manage plans.

Select Create Membership Plan and enter a name for the membership. This name will be displayed in emails, receipts, and the client portal.

Select Credit to account balance and select Create.

Link copied
Details tab

In the Details tab, update the billing details for the membership.

Set the Price to the amount the client will pay every billing period. Set the Amount added to account balance to the amount that will be added to the client’s account balance every billing period. For example, you can charge clients $100, but add $120 to their account balance.

Memberships can be billed in day, week, or month intervals. For example, use 1 Month for monthly memberships, and 12 Months for annual memberships. The minimum billing interval is every 7 days.

Account balance memberships do not charge service tax when the membership is billed because client account balances can be used to pay for any sales, not just service sales.

Link copied
Discounts tab

In the Discounts tab, specify any product or service discounts included in the membership. These discounts will be automatically applied to all products and services purchased by clients with active memberships. You can manually remove these discounts during checkout if they do not apply to certain products or services.

If you’d like to choose which products or services are eligible for a discount, you can create an offer instead and limit it to clients with this membership.

Link copied
Agreement tab

In the Agreement tab, specify whether clients should be required to sign an agreement when starting the membership in person and online. Signed agreements can help protect your business and set clear expectations for clients.

When creating your agreement, things to keep in mind include:

If you make changes to the agreement later, agreements that have already been signed will not be affected.

The current membership price and billing frequency will be automatically included in the agreement. If you change your membership price or billing frequency, agreements that have already been signed will not be affected.

If you switch a client’s membership to the current version of the plan, or if you change the price/discount on a client’s membership, the client’s signed agreement will not be affected.

Learn more about membership agreements.

Link copied
Online Sales tab

In the Online Sales tab, specify whether the membership should be available to purchase online. Learn more about selling memberships online.

Once you’ve created the membership plan, learn how to start a new membership for a client or sell memberships online.

Once a client has an active account balance membership, they can add money to their account balance every billing period and use the funds during checkout.

Link copied
Reordering membership plans

To reorder your membership plans, simply drag and drop the membership plan name. This will control the order in which the membership plans are listed when selling memberships in person and online.
