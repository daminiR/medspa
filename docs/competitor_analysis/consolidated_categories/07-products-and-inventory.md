Purchase Orders

Purchase orders (POs) are documents used to order products from suppliers.

In Mangomint, you can easily create a list of products and quantities to order from each of your suppliers based on your preset inventory preferences. The system will check your current stock levels against how many products you want on hand so you order just the right amount.

Purchase orders are created based on suppliers. If you need to order from multiple suppliers, you will need to create separate POs for each supplier.

To enable purchase orders, go to Apps > Manage apps > Purchase Orders and select Enable.

Stock: Current stock level.

Desired: Desired quantity on hand based on your product settings. Learn how to set the desired quantity on hand.

On Order: Quantity that is currently on another open purchase order for this supplier.

Total: Quantity multiplied by the product cost.

After confirming all products and quantities are correct, select Save.

Use the Download button to download the purchase order as a PDF to send to your supplier or select Download as Excel from the "..." menu to download the purchase order as a CSV file.

Set Up Products for Purchase Orders

Before you can add a product to a purchase order (PO), you must assign a supplier and a desired quantity on hand to the product. Adding a desired quantity on hand to products automatically sets the order quantity on your purchase orders.

Link copied
Setting up products for purchase orders

To set up products for purchase orders, open the Products app and select the product. If you need to create a new product, follow these steps.

Select the pencil icon to edit the product.

Select a supplier for the product. If you need to add a new supplier, follow these steps.

Enter the Desired quantity on hand. This is the ideal quantity to have on hand for this product. When the product's stock level is below this quantity and the product is added to a PO, the order quantity is automatically calculated based on the desired quantity.

For example, if you have 3 products currently in stock and your desired quantity on hand is 24, the system will automatically add 21 products to the purchase order.

Select Save Changes to update the product.

Basic Service Commission
Sliding Scale Service Commission
Product Commission

To adjust service and product commission settings for a staff member, open the Staff Members app and select the staff member. Select the Compensation tab. You must be an Admin user to adjust a staff member’s compensation settings.

Learn more about how commission is calculated with service customizations.

Link copied
Basic Service Commission

Basic service commission is calculated as a flat percentage of total sales (after discounts). This will be the default percentage for all services performed by this staff member.

Once the default percentage is set, you can set different commission rates for specific services if needed.

Open the Staff Members app and select the staff member. Select the Services tab and select Additional options.

Enter a flat amount or a percentage that will only apply to this staff member and service.

Link copied
Sliding Scale Service Commission

With sliding scale service commission, the percentage depends on the amount sold. This allows you to set multiple percentages for the staff member based on different tiers.

Here is an example of a sliding scale service commission:

$0 - $1,499.99: 40%

$1,500 - $2,999.99: 45%

$3,000 and up: 50%

To calculate sliding scale service commission, select Zero-based or Progressive.

Link copied
Zero-based

This is the most common way of calculating sliding-based commission. With Zero-based, the percentage for the highest tier that the staff member reached will be applied to the entire service total for the payroll period.

In the image above, if the staff member sells $4,000 during the payroll period, their commission is 50% which is $2,000.

Link copied
Progressive

With Progressive, the percentages are only applied to their respective tiers.

In the image above, if the staff member sells $4,000 during the payroll period, their commission would be as follows:

Link copied
Product Commission

Product commission is calculated as a percentage of product sales (after discounts). This will be the default percentage for all products sold by this staff member.

To allow non-service providers (such as front desk staff) to be eligible for product sales, enable the Can be assigned to product sales toggle in Apps > Staff Members > Details.
