Using Image Markup on a Form

Image Markup allows you to mark up client photos and image templates on forms using different annotation tools.

With Image Markup, you can:

Draw on an image to emphasize specific areas and write notes

Add shapes like arrows or rectangles to identify target areas

Use comments on staff member forms to document important details, such as units used for injectable services

To learn more about Image Markup, the following on-demand videos are available:

Video: Image Markup for Med Spas

Video: Image Markup for Massage Therapy Practices

Image Markup is available on all forms, including client, staff member, and external forms.

On client forms, a client can add their own photo to the form and mark up the photo themselves before their appointment.

On staff member forms, a staff member can add the client’s photo to the form and mark up the photo as needed.

Using Image Markup

To use Image Markup on a form, create a form template and add the Image Markup field.

You can add as many Image Markup fields as needed to the form. This allows you to mark up multiple images on the same form.

Prompt: This text appears directly above the image on the form.

Enabled markup tools: Select the markup tools that should be available when marking up the image.

Template: Select this option to use an image template on the form.

User provided: Select this option to add the image to the form when the form is filled out.

Require this field: Enable this toggle to require the image to be added and marked up.

Select the Preview tab to see what the form will look like when enabled.

Once the form template is enabled, select Mark up image on the form to mark up the image.

MANAGING FORM SUBMISSIONS
Approving a Form Submission

When creating form templates, you can specify whether a form needs to be reviewed and approved once submitted. This can be helpful for med spas if a medical director or doctor needs to sign off on a form after it’s submitted.

Link copied
Setting up a form to require approval

To create and modify form templates, you must be an Admin user, or you must have the Can manage form templates permission enabled in Staff Member settings.

To set up a form to require approval, open the Forms app and select Manage templates.

Select the form that requires approval. In the Details tab, select which type of approval is required.

Review required: The selected staff member must approve the form submission by selecting an Approve button.

Review & signature required: The selected staff member must approve the form submission by adding their signature.

When selecting which staff member can approve the form submission, you can select a specific staff member for each location. If you select multiple staff members for a location, any of those staff members can approve the form submission.

Link copied
Approving a form submission

In the Forms app, form submissions that require approval have a status of Needs Review.

If you are the selected approver for the form template, you can approve a form submission by reviewing the information and selecting Approve or Sign for Approval.

Once approved, the form submission will change from Needs Review to Completed in the Forms app.

Saving Progress on a Form

Staff members can save their progress on a form and submit the form at a later time. This allows a staff member to work on a form over time instead of having to fill out and submit the form in one sitting.

For example, a staff member can:

Begin filling out a form (such as SOAP notes) at the beginning of the appointment.

Save and close the form.

Finish and submit the form after the appointment.

This feature also allows multiple staff members to work on the same form for increased collaboration.

Saving progress on a form

To save progress on a form, select Save Progress & Close from the "..." menu.

Note: 

If the form has a Signature field and a signature was added, the signature will not be saved. This is to avoid the form being edited after it has been signed. To save the signature, submit the form instead of saving it.

Once the form is saved, it will show the last time it was modified.

In the Forms app, the form will have a status of In Progress until it is submitted.

If you need to discard progress on a form, select Discard Form from the "..." menu. This will reset the form by deleting all saved changes.
